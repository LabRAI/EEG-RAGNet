Implementation of EEG-RAGNet: Retrieval-Augmented Graph Structure Refinement for Clinical Seizure Diagnosis
---

## Overview

EEG-RAGNet (Retrieval-Augmented Dynamic Graph Neural Network for EEG-based Epilepsy Diagnosis) is an advanced framework for epilepsy diagnosis using EEG signals.
 It extends a Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) architecture with **knowledge-driven refinement**.

Unlike existing graph learning-based EEG seizure detection methods, EEG-RAGNet integrates domain knowledge through a **retrieval-augmented pipeline**,
 allowing the model to dynamically refine its learned brain connectivity graph using biomedical knowledge extracted from epilepsy guidelines and scientific literature.
