Disorders\nPreface iii\nPublication of Clinical Practice Guidelines for Neurological Diseases\nIn 2001, the Executive Board of the Japanese Society of Neurology decided to develop clinical practice guidelines for the\nmajor neurological diseases, based on a proposal by the then President Nobuo Yanagisawa. In 2002, “Treatment Guidelines\n2002” for six diseases comprising “chronic headache”, “Parkinson disease, “epilepsy”, “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis”,\n“dementia”, and “cerebrovascular disease” were published.\nFollowing the publication of “Treatment Guidelines 2002”, new knowledge was accumulated at an accelerated rate. In\n2008, the Executive Board of the Japanese Society of Neurology (Past President, Shigeki Kuzuhara) decided to revise the\nguidelines. Six guideline development committees were organized to develop “Treatment Guidelines 2010” for “chronic\nheadache” (published in 2013), “dementia” (published in 2010), “epilepsy” (published in 2010), “multiple sclerosis” (published\nin 2010), “Parkinson disease” (published in 2011), and cerebrovascular disease (published in 2009), as well as a guideline\ndevelopment committee for “genetic diagnosis of neurological disorders” (published in 2009).\nOn the occasion of the development of “Treatment Guidelines 2010”, the Japanese Society of Neurology established a\nconsistent structure, the guideline development committee, and procedures for all the guidelines to be developed by the\nSociety. Regarding conflicts of interest, the committee members involved in the development of these guidelines submitted\nto the President a “Japan Neurological Society Declaration of Conflict of Interest” and obtained an “Approval Regarding\nConflict of Interest” from the Japanese Society of Neurology. With the exception of Parkinson’s disease, the revised guidelines\nfor all other diseases were developed by joint committees with corroboration from other academic societies.\nThe guidelines published between 2009 and 2011 were those for representative neurological diseases. However, due to an\nincrease in demand of guidelines for other neurological diseases, a decision was made at the Executive Board in 2011 to\npublish new clinical practice guidelines for six additional neurological disorders (Guillain-Barré syndrome/Fisher syndrome,\nchronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy/multifocal motor neuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, bacterial\nmeningitis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and myasthenia gravis). These guidelines were published in 2013‒2014, and have\nbeen widely used clinically as “Guidelines 2013”.\nFor the present series of guideline revision/development, revision of the guidelines for “genetic diagnosis” (published in\n2009), “epilepsy” (published in 2010), “dementia” (published in 2010), “multiple sclerosis” (published in 2010), and\n“Parkinson disease” (published in 2011) as well as development of guidelines for “herpes simplex encephalitis” and “dystonia”\nwere approved at the Executive Board in 2013, while the development of “Clinical practice guideline for spinocerebella\ndegeneration and multiple system atrophy” was approved at the Executive Board in 2014.\nAs with previous guidelines, revision or development of the above guidelines was based on the concept of evidence-based\nmedicine (EBM) and guided by Minds Manual for Guideline Development 2007 edition, or 2014 edition for those guidelines\nthat were able to utilize the 2014 edition (guidelines for multiple sclerosis/neuromyelitis optica, Parkinson’s disease, and\nepilepsy were developed according to the 2014 edition). The 2014 edition recommends introduction of the GRADE system,\nwith the participation of both patients and medical staff in formulating the clinical questions. The GRADE system approach\nis also adopted as a part of the new guidelines.\nClinical practice guidelines are developed based on current medical knowledge with the purpose to assist clinicians in\nmaking clinical decisions to provide appropriate medical care. Clinical care provided for each patient should be decided\nindividually by the attending doctor based on all the clinical data, and the clinical practice guidelines by no means restrict\nthe clinical discretion of doctors. Clinical practice guidelines are not supposed to be applicable to all the patients; they are\ncreated as a reference for each treatment setting after the doctor has accurately grasped the patient’s condition.\nTreatments for neurological diseases are advancing rapidly, and the clinical practice guidelines will need to be revised\nregularly in the future. We sincerely hope that the new clinical practice guidelines will help members of our Society in their\nroutine medical practice, and we look forward to your evaluations and opinions to improve the clinical practice guidelines\nfor the next revision.\nMay 2017\nHidehiro Mizusawa, Past President\nRyosuke Takahashi, Executive President\nGen Sobue, Past Chairman, Guideline Executive Committee\nSatoshi Kamei, Chairman, Guideline Executive Committee\nJapanese Society of Neurology\niv Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\nRevision of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy\nIntroduction\nEpilepsy affects a large number of people, and many doctors other than epilepsy specialists are involved in providing\ntreatment for these patients. For this reason, the Epilepsy Treatment Guideline Development Committee developed the\nEpilepsy Treatment Guideline 2010 as a guide for general practitioners who treat patients with epilepsy. Following publication\nof the guideline, new antiepileptic drugs were launched, and the British epilepsy guideline (NICE) was revised, so was\nepilepsy classification by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). In this revision, descriptions of new antiepileptic\ndrugs have been added. As the first attempt of the Society, systematic review was performed using the GRADE (Grading of\nRecommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system for three clinical questions (CQ) to be described later.\nAnti-NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis, the treatment method of which has drawn attention in recent years, is also\ndescribed in the revised guideline, together with a brief summary of the latest diagnosis, tests, treatments and prognosis of\nadult and childhood epilepsies.\nAdopting the same approach as the previous edition, this revised guideline uses the format consisting of CQ (purpose) and\nits answer. The CQs that have been systematically reviewed are colored in green to distinguish them from other CQs, and\nthe strength of recommendation and quality of evidence are described, followed by comment on the evidence. For the other\nCQs, “Summary” is used to describe the overall opinions of experts (colored in red), followed by comment.\nThis guideline was prepared by the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy Development Committee (abbreviated as\nGuideline Development Committee hereinafter) of the Japanese Society of Neurology, and was developed in collaboration\nwith the Japan Epilepsy Society, the Japan Neurosurgical Society, the Japan Society of Child Neurology, and the Japanese\nSociety of Neurological Therapeutics. The Guideline Development Committee consists of neurologists, pediatricians,\npsychiatrists, and neurosurgeons who are members of the above-mentioned academic societies.\n1. F unding Sources for the development of Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy and conflicts\nof Interest (COI) of committee members\nPreparation of this guideline was funded by the Japanese Society of Neurology. The proceeds from sales of this guideline\nwill be appropriated to cover the cost of preparation.\nThe chairman, vice-chairman, committee members, external members, collaborators, and evaluation/coordination\ncommittee members who are involved in the preparation of this guideline have submitted the “Declaration Form of Conflict\nof Interest for Preparation of the Japanese Society of Neurology Clinical Practice Guidelines” to the Executive President of\nthe Japanese Society of Neurology, and obtained approval from the Japanese Society of Neurology for the disclosure of\nconflicts of interest.\nThe companies that have declared COI are shown below.\n• ASKA Pharmaceutical Co.

On the use of this guideline\nThis clinical practice guideline provides recommendations to support the clinical decisions of healthcare professionals,\nand the recommendations have no enforcing power. The actual clinical decision should be made upon comprehensively\nconsidering not only this clinical practice guideline, but also the latest evidence, patient values, and environmental factors.\nThis clinical practice guideline does not promise to improve clinical outcomes. The Guideline Development Committee\nis not responsible for the results of medical treatments conducted using this clinical practice guideline.\nThis clinical practice guideline is not supposed to be used as evidence in a medical lawsuit. Since decision-making in\nactual clinical practice is based on comprehensive assessments including patients’ values and environmental factors while\nreferring to the recommendations in the clinical practice guidelines, providing medical treatment that deviates from the\nrecommendations of the clinical practice guideline does not necessarily imply negligence. This Guideline Development\nCommittee does not approve the use of this clinical practice guideline as evidence in a legal trial.\n3. Outline of the method of systematic review (Part II)\nIn the present guideline, systematic review was conducted in three CQs described below, and the digest is summarized in\nPart II. Details are published on the website of Japanese Society of Neurology.\nCQ9-2 Should temporal lobe resection be added to drug therapy in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy?\nCQ10-1 Should vagus nerve stimulation therapy be added to drug therapies for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy?\nCQ10-2 When conducting vagus nerve stimulation for drug resistant epilepsy, which intensity of stimulation (high or\nlow) should we use?\nThe recommendations were made according to the GRADE system, which is an international standard approach for\nguideline development. In the GRADE system, a systematic review is conducted for each outcome; then based on the results,\na panel meeting is convened to formulate the recommendations.\nFormulating clinical question (CQ)\nThe CQ was decided by the Guideline Development Committee, as the clinical issue for which a recommendations can\nbe expected to improve the quality of diagnosis and treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy.\nCQ was formulated by the PICO format. PICO is the acronym for patient (P), intervention (I), comparison (C) and\noutcome (C). For each CQ, outcome was decided at the Guideline Development Committee meeting. The outcome was\ngraded on a scale of 9 to 1 in descending order of importance. Eventually, outcomes graded as critical (scores 9 to 7) or\nimportant (scores 6 to 4) were selected for systematic review.\nLiterature search\nWe requested a librarian who had a contract with Japanese Society of Neurology to construct literature search formulae\nand conduct literature search. MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL were used in the search. From the articles yielded from\nthe search, duplicates were excluded, the remaining papers were screened by title and abstract, then the full texts were\nevaluated, and sorted by outcome. Only literature of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was adopted for systematic review.\nThe outline of literature search is shown in the flow diagram.\nIntegrating evidence data\nFor each CQ, meta-analysis was conducted for each outcome, where possible. Meta-analysis was performed using the\nCochrane standard application, Review Manager (RevMan) [Computer program] version 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic\nCochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).\nFixed-effect models were used for integration of outcomes: Mantel-Haenszel method was used when the outcomes were\nbinary variables, and inverse variance method was used when the outcomes were continuous variables.\nRisk ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated for outcomes that were binary variables, and mean difference and\nstandard deviation were calculated for outcomes that were continuous variables, and presented as forest plots.\nWhen the data was not adequate for performing meta-analysis, requests were made to the researchers to obtain more data.\nEvaluating quality of evidence\nThe quality of evidence was evaluated by the method proposed by the GRADE working group, and was graded as “high”,\n“moderate”, “low”, and “very low”. Since only RCTs were evaluated in this clinical practice guideline, the quality of evidence\nstarted from a score of “high”. From there, the score might be downgraded depending on the result of evaluation of the\nvi Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\nfollowing: “risk of bias”, “inconsistency: variation of treatment estimates between studies”, “indirectness: dissociation\nbetween PICO of primary study and PICO of CQ”, “imprecision: low precision of the effect estimate due to small number\nof samples or events”, and “publication bias: influence by studies that are not published due to negative results”, according to\nthe method defined by the GARDE working group.\nAfter determining the final quality of evidence, the results of systematic review were tabulated in the Summary of Findings\n(SoF) table and GRADE Evidence Profile. GRADEproGDT (https://gradepro.org/) was used for tabulation.\nDetermination of overall quality of evidence for all outcomes\nFor each CQ, we adopted the highest quality of evidence if the effects of all the important outcomes were in the same\ndirection of either benefit or harm to the patient. On the other hand, we adopted the lowest quality of evidence if the effects\nof some outcomes were in the direction of benefit while others were in the direction of harm . This quality of evidence is\nsynonymous with the “certainty of evidence” in the recommendation statement.\nIn the alphabetical notation of GRADE, “high” certainty of evidence is represented by “A”, “moderate” by “B”, “low” by\n“C”, and “very low” by “D”.\nFormulating recommendation from evidence\nRecommendation was formulated using the SoF table and GRADE Evidence Profile.\nFour factors determine recommendation: “overall quality of evidence for all outcomes”, “balance of benefit and harm”,\n“variation in values and preferences” and “resources (cost)”.\nTo determine recommendation at the panel meeting, the following were discussed: “priority of the issue”, “desirable\neffects”, “undesirable effects”, “certainty of evidence”, “uncertainty and diversity of values towards major outcomes”, “balance\nbetween desirable and undesired effects”, “costs and resources required”, “acceptability to stakeholders”, and “feasibility”.\nThe results are described in in the former half of the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) table; “Evaluation table of recommendation\njudgment criteria”.\nThen, based on the “Evaluation table of criteria for determining recommendation”, consensus was formed regarding the\nstrength and direction of recommendation. The grade of recommendation was presented by a combination of the strength\ndetermined as “strong or weak” and the direction determined as “recommended or not recommended”. In GRADE numerical\nnotation, strong recommendation is represented by “1” and weak recommendation by “2”. The rationale for the\nrecommendation is shown in the latter part of the EtD table; “Recommendation decision table”.\nPanel meeting\nPanelists participated in the panel meeting include epilepsy specialists (neurologists, pediatricians, psychiatrists and\nneurosurgeons) who are members of the Clinical Practice Guideline Developing Committee, as well as primary care\nphysicians, representatives of patients’ families, lawyers, and all other stakeholders.\nA panel meeting was held on October 23, 2016, in which CQ9-2, CQ10-1 and CQ10-2 were discussed from noon to\nevening. The panel meeting was moderated by Eishu Nango, an expert in clinical practice guideline development methods.\nAfter commenting on the GRADE system, participants discussed based on the SoF table, GRADE Evidence Profile, and\ndraft recommendation statements.\nFor CQ10-1 and CQ10-2, the recommendations were unanimously agreed. Regarding CQ9-2, almost all the panelists\nexpressed the opinion that the strength of recommendation was “strong”, but the certainty of evidence was “very low”.\nTherefore, “weak recommendation” was decided according to the GRADE rules.\nWriting the clinical practice guidelines\nBased on the recommendations decided at the panel meeting, the draft of the guidelines was written, was externally\nevaluated, and then finalized.\nPreface vii\n4.

In other words,\nepilepsy is a chronic brain disease, in which abnormal hyperexcitable neurons in the brain cause recurrence of seizure\nsymptoms. Seizures occur suddenly, manifesting physical symptoms different from the normal state, altered\nconsciousness, and motor and sensory changes. The possibility of epilepsy is adequately high if accompanied by\nseizures.\nComment\nCerebral neurons generate regular rhythm electrically, while maintaining synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.\nEpilepsy is caused by a sudden disturbance of this activity accompanied by abnormal, disorderly discharges of the electrical\nactivities of neurons in the brain (excessive excitation or synchronization). This may occur in an afebrile state, and the seizure\nsymptoms are diverse depending on the region of the brain that is involved in the abnormal electrical activity1). These\nsymptoms include not only “convulsions and spasms” but also various symptoms such as “feeling black out”, “jerking of the\nbody”, “moving around with loss of consciousness” (see CQ1-4 on page 10, and CQ1-5 on page 11). In addition, epilepsy is\ncharacterized by recurrence. Electroencephalography (EEG) has a central role in various examinations and is necessary to\nestablish the diagnosis (see CQ1-6 on page 13).\nTraditionally, epilepsy was defined as “two unprovoked seizures occurring at intervals of longer than 24 hours”. In 2014,\na task force of the International League Against Epilepsy Organization (ILAE) recognized that epilepsy may be present in\nspecial circumstances that do not meet the criteria of “two unprovoked seizures”. In order to address this issue, the task force\nproposed to consider epilepsy as a disease of the brain defined by any of the following criteria2): (1) at least two unprovoked\n(or reflex) seizures occurring at intervals of longer than 24 hours; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of\nfurther seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next\n10 years (see Note below); and (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome.\nThe term “unprovoked seizure” is a term that describes spontaneous seizure as a chronic disease without a definitive\ntrigger. In contrast, “provoked seizure” is also known as acute symptomatic seizure or situation-related seizure, which occurs\nsecondary to acute brain disorders such as encephalitis, trauma, cerebrovascular disorders, and metabolic disorders 3).\nNote: Number (2) in the second paragraph signifies that if there is one unprovoked seizure and the risk of recurrence can\nbe proven to be over 60%, then patient care should be initiated assuming a diagnosis of epilepsy. Some specific examples\ninclude patients with a single seizure occurring at least one month after onset of stroke, and children with a single seizure\nsimultaneous with a structural or indirect symptomatic etiology for the symptom and an epileptiform EEG. Another example\nis patients in whom a specific epilepsy syndrome associated with persistent threshold change can be detected after a single\nseizure. Even when the first seizure manifests as status epilepticus, this by itself does not imply epilepsy 2)\n.\n2 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\n▪ References\n1) Iinuma K, Fujiwara T, Ikeda A, et al.

The ILAE classifications are widely used. Diagnosis of epilepsy for patients has important\nsignificance on physical, mental, social and economic status. Therefore, it is recommended that specialists conduct\ndefinitive clinical diagnosis of epilepsy.\nComment\nCurrently, the following ILAE classifications are widely used in Japan: the classification of epileptic seizures of 1981 1) and\nthe classification of epilepsies, epileptic syndromes and related seizure disorders of 1989 2). However, the ILAE task force\nproposed a new disease classification in 2010 3). Tables 1 and 2 show the corresponding classification categories in the new\nand old classifications of 1981, 1989 and 2010 4). This guideline follows the classification of seizure types of 1981, in which\nepileptic seizures are divided into partial and generalized seizures. “Partial” is used to indicate “focal” or “localization-\nrelated”.\nThe feature of the 1981 classification of seizure types is based on an accurate correspondence between seizure symptoms\nand EEG findings (left column of Table 1), and the scheme is based on “epileptic discharge” on EEG, which is the information\nwith the highest sensitivity and specificity. On the other hand, the feature of the 1989 classification of epilepsies and epilepsy\nsyndromes is based on a 2 × 2 classification table (left column of Table 2). With this classification, idiopathic epilepsies and\nsyndromes are not necessary only generalized epilepsies but also include some partial epilepsies. Conversely, within\nsymptomatic epilepsies and syndromes, partial epilepsies and generalized epilepsies are both clearly classified. Furthermore,\namong these four categories, apart from symptomatic partial epilepsies, all the others have in principle age-dependent onset\nand reflect the element of onset age at the same time.\n1. Idiopathic partial epilepsies are benign, (1) with childhood onset, (2) manifest localization-related seizure symptoms and\nlocalized EEG findings, (3) show no abnormal neuroimaging findings, and (4) remit by adolescence. This category\nincludes benign epilepsy with centrotemporal sharp waves and Panayiotopoulos type with focus in the occipital region.\n2. Symptoms suggestive of symptomatic partial epilepsies include: (1) a history of disease that may constitute the etiology,\n(2) aura, (3) local motor or sensory signs at onset or during seizure, and (4) automatism. However, even with absence\nseizures, automatism may sometimes occur.\n3. Idiopathic generalized epilepsies rarely have onset older than at 25 years of age and show no other neurological symptoms.\nThe symptoms suggesting this category include: (1) childhood onset (before adolescence), (2) induced by sleep deprivation\nand alcohol, (3) tonic-clonic seizure or myoclonic seizure immediately after waking, (4) seizure type is absence, with no\nother neurologic symptoms (5) spontaneous photoreaction on EEG, including generalized 3-Hz spike-and-slow-wave\ncomplexes or multiple spike-and-slow-wave complexes.\n4. Symptoms suggestive of symptomatic generalized epilepsies include: (1) very early onset (neonatal period, infancy: under\n1 year of age), (2) frequent seizures, (3) mental retardation and neurological symptoms from before onset, (4) progression\nand regression of neurological symptoms, (5) diffuse EEG abnormalities, and (6) organic morphological abnormalities in\nthe brain.\n6 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\nThe basic concepts for the 2010 classifications are as follows.\n1. Modes of seizure manifestation and classification of seizures\nThe term partial seizure is eliminated, and is replaced by “focal seizures” (with or without impairment of consciousness)\n(right column of Table 1). “Generalized” and “focal” are redefined. Generalized seizures are seizures that occur within the\nnetwork of bilateral cerebral hemispheres, and this network is rapidly involved in seizure. Focal seizures are seizures that\noccur within the network limited to unilateral cerebral hemisphere and is either discretely localized or more widely\ndistributed within unilateral hemisphere.\n2. Classification of underlying causes\nInstead of the traditional terms “idiopathic”, “symptomatic” and “cryptogenic”, the 2010 classification recommends\nmodified concepts using the new terms “genetic”, “structural-metabolic” and “unknown”.\nThis chapter is based on the classifications reported up to the time of this writing (2016), and the classifications published\nthereafter are not addressed.\n▪ References\n1) Proposal for revised clinical and electroencephalographic classification of epileptic seizures.

In the\ndiagnosis of epilepsy, we should exclude or consider an associated cardiovascular factor 2). A syncope attack is characterized\nby no change in consciousness level, fatigue, and malaise after an attack 3, 4). Patients who develop acute convulsion within 1\nweek after head injury have an overall risk of approximately 25% for developing epilepsy in the future 3).

Procedures for the diagnosis of epilepsy.\nChapter 1 13\nChapter 2\nExaminations for Clinical Practice\nof Epilepsy\nCQ 2-1\nHow useful is EEG for the diagnosis of epilepsy?\nSummary\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is the most useful clinical examination for the diagnosis of epilepsy. In a\nconsiderable number of patients, however, epileptic discharges cannot be detected by only a single routine EEG\nexamination, and multiple EEG recordings including sleep or sleep-deprived EEG are required.\nComment\nDiagnosis of epilepsy is conducted in accordance with the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of\nepileptic seizure types (1981) as well as classification of epilepsies, epileptic syndromes and related seizure disorders (1989).\nThus, EEG findings are essential in addition to clinical seizure types and neurological symptoms. Regarding the EEG\nrecording methods, it is desirable to follow the guidelines of the Japanese Society of Clinical Neurophysiology 1).\nHowever, in a considerable number of patients, seizure discharges cannot be detected by a single routine EEG examination.\nIn a systematic review of 12 articles with evidence levels of classes I and II [as defined by the American Academy of Neurology\n(AAN)] comprising 1,766 adult patients, approximately 50% of the patients with epilepsy had normal EEG 2). Regarding the\nquestion of how many EEG examinations are needed to exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy, there is no solid evidence-based\nanswer. However, some reports indicate that the more EEG examinations are repeated, the higher is the epileptic discharges\ndetection rate on EEG 3).\nIn addition, the diagnostic value of sleep EEG is high. In patients in whom no epileptic discharges are detected in awake\nrecordings, epileptic discharges are often detected by sleep EEG 3). Especially, it has been reported that during sleep, the\nepileptic discharges detection rate is higher in children than in adults, and higher for partial epilepsy than for generalized\nepilepsy.\nHowever, even if epileptic discharges are recorded in EEG, unless the discharges can explain the seizure symptom, this\nfinding alone does not necessarily lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy. Abnormal EEG activity is also seen in some normal persons,\nand one paper reported that epileptiform discharges were recorded in 0.5% (69/13,658) of normal persons 3).\nA recent systematic review of 15 articles with a total of 1,799 patients presenting with a first unprovoked seizure analyzed\nthe (1) sensitivity (percentage of patients with epileptiform discharges on routine EEG among those who had repeated\nseizures during one-year follow-up and hence were diagnosed with epilepsy) and (2) specificity (percentage of patients finally\ndiagnosed with epilepsy among those who were found to have epileptiform discharges on routine EEG) separately in children\nand adults 4). In adults, (1) sensitivity was 17.3% and (2) specificity was 94.7%. In children, (1) sensitivity was 58.7% and (2)\nspecificity was 69.6%.\n▪ References\n1) Japanese Society of Clinical Neurophysiology, Clinical Electroencephalography Examination Standards Revision Committee.

In the treatment of epilepsy patients, it is important to follow the pattern of appearance of epileptic\ndischarges and their frequency over time 1, 2). In particular, in patients with absence seizure, since the occurrence rate of 3-Hz\nspike-and-wave complex on EEG reflects the disease severity, it is useful to do follow-up EEG in order to monitor the\ntherapeutic effect 3). Also, the type of epilepsy may change, and EEG examination is useful to capture this change 3). However,\nthere is a lack of clear evidence on these issues, and epilepsy patients do not always show abnormal findings in EEG\nexaminations. On the other hand, even if epileptiform discharges are detected, if they are interictal abnormalities and the\npatient is clinically seizure-free, we do not always need to increase the drug dose or add a new antiepileptic drug. Hence, we\nshould interpret EEG findings during the treatment process taking into account the clinical course and other findings.\nFurthermore, regarding the question of how often EEG examination should be done during epilepsy treatment, there is no\nsolid evidence.\n▪ References\n1) Fowle AJ, Binnie CD.

The main purpose of this examination is to record “habitual\nseizures”. While seizures are recorded at a rate of 2.5‒7% in routine EEG examinations, reports have shown that seizures are\nrecorded in 70‒85% of the patients when VEEG is performed for 3.5‒6 days 1, 2).\nBy analyzing the video (seizure symptoms) and EEG (ictal EEG findings), the following can be achieved: (1) differentiation\nof epileptic seizure from non-epileptic seizure; (2) in the case of epileptic seizure, differentiation of generalized seizure from\npartial seizure; (3) in the case of focal seizure, localization of epileptogenic zone 3). Recordings for long duration sometimes\nreveal seizures not accompanied by clinical symptoms and interictal abnormalities not usually captured by routine EEG. The\nresults of the VEEG study may greatly advance the diagnosis and treatment strategy or change them considerably. According\nto previous reports, the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy were altered in 55‒60% of the patients who underwent VEEG 1-3).\nPatients suspected of being refractory to drug therapy should undergo VEEG examination in a specialized facility 4). VEEG\nis not only important in localization of the epileptogenic zone for epilepsy surgery, but is also useful for making a definitive\ndiagnosis of epilepsy and defining the disease type.\n▪ References\n1) Michel V, Mazzola L, Lemesle M, et al.

MRI is especially useful in the diagnosis of partial epilepsy.\nComment\nMRI or CT examination is essential for the diagnosis of epilepsy 1-3). However, this does not apply to idiopathic generalized\nepilepsy or idiopathic partial epilepsy, because organic lesions are rarely found in these epilepsies. Although there is no class\nI and II evidence based on direct comparison between MRI and CT, MRI is considered to have higher diagnostic utility\nthan CT, and is the first choice among several imaging studies 1). Especially when making a diagnosis of partial epilepsy,\nMRI is a requisite. However, CT is preferable in the case of emergency, when the patient has a contraindication for MRI, or\nwhen a calcified lesion is suspected 4).\nSpecifically, the “practical clinical definition of epilepsy” reported by ILAE in 2014 recommends making a diagnosis of\nepilepsy in patients presenting with a first unprovoked seizure in whom MRI or CT examination shows organic lesions\nsuggesting stroke, central nervous system infection, and traumatic brain injury, even though they have experienced only one\nseizure episode 2), because these patients have a high risk of seizure recurrence.\nRegarding MRI imaging methods, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images are useful in addition to the\nconventional T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. FLAIR images have been reported to enhance the diagnostic sensitivity\nfor epileptogenic lesions such as hippocampal sclerosis and cortical dysplasia. For detecting hippocampal sclerosis, cross-\nsectional images perpendicular and parallel to the long axis of the hippocampus are needed 5). Also, 3 Tesla MRI is useful\nwhen evaluating the indication for epilepsy surgery 6). It is reported that 3 Tesla MRI depicts some lesions, such as hippocampal\nsclerosis, cortical dysplasia, and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT), which are not detected by 1.5 Tesla MRI 6).\n▪ References\n1) Krumholz A, Wiebe S, Gronseth G, et al.

Although the usefulness of\nthese modalities in preoperative diagnosis is yet to be established 1), they may be useful in localizing MRI-negative\nepileptogenic zones. Even for MRI-positive lesions (with MRI structural lesions), additional information may be obtained.\nNuclear medicine imaging techniques include positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed\ntomography (SPECT). In general, epileptogenic zones exhibit reduced metabolism or blood flow during the interictal period,\nand increased metabolism or blood flow during the ictal period. The above examinations are conducted to image these\nchanges in an attempt to identify the epileptogenic zone. PET methods include FDG-PET using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose\n(FDG) to observe glucose metabolism, and SPECT methods include cerebral blood flow SPECT using N-isopropyl-123I-p-\niodoamphetamine (IMP) or 99mTc-ethyl-cysteinate dimer (ECD) to measure cerebral blood flow.\nThe spatial resolution of FDG-PET is higher than that of SPECT, and the detection power of epileptogenic zone is also\nhigher. Hence, FDG-PET may be useful for the detection of MRI-negative epileptogenic zone 2). Especially, coregistering\nFDG-PET image to MRI enables us to know the accurate distribution of the regions with reduced metabolism. On the other\nhand, while many reports have indicated that ictal SPECT, which captures the high blood flow region at the time of seizure,\nis the most powerful method to detect the responsible focus, there is no clear evidence to support it 2). Another powerful\nmethod is the subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM). In this method, the regions of statistically increased\nblood flow obtained by subtracting the interictal SPECT image from the ictal SPECT image are superimposed on MRI. This\nmethod is useful for detecting the epileptogenic zone in extra-temporal lobe epilepsy or MRI-negative partial epilepsy 3, 4).\nIomazenil SPECT using 123I-iomazenil depicts the distribution of central benzodiazepine receptors (BZR). Central BZR\ncouples with the GABA receptor (the primary inhibitory neurotransmitters) to form the chloride channel. These inhibitory\nA\nneurotransmitters are presumably decreased in the epileptogenic zone. Thus, iomazenil SPECT was anticipated to be capable\nof directly depicting their distribution. However, there is no clear evidence for its usefulness 5).\nMEG is a neuromagnetic technique that measures the magnetic field generated by electrical activity of neurons. This\nmethod estimates the location of electrical source of interictal epileptic discharges. Magnetic source imaging is the technique\nof superimposing this electrical source on anatomical MRI. This method is a useful tool for noninvasive presurgical evaluation\nof epilepsy surgery 6). When all noninvasive presurgical examinations fail to pinpoint the location of the epileptogenic zone,\nwe should perform invasive EEG recording using subdural electrodes. In that case, magnetic source imaging provides useful\ninformation for deciding the sites of electrode placement. Use of magnetic source imaging in presurgical epilepsy evaluation\nhas been found to correlate significantly with postoperative seizure-free outcome 7, 8).\nChapter 2 19\n▪ References\n1) Ryvlin P, Cross JH, Rheims S.

Even after a first seizure, treatment initiation is considered if there is a neurological\nabnormality, an abnormal electroencephalogram, a lesion shown by neuroimaging studies, or a family history of\nepilepsy, because the recurrence rate is high under the above conditions. Treatment may be started after a first seizure\nin some patients in consideration of the patient’s social situation or desire. In the elderly, treatment is considered\nafter a first seizure since the risk of recurrence after the initial seizure is high. After a second seizure, starting\nantiepileptic drug is recommended because the risk of seizure recurrence within one year is high.\nComment\nPatients with a first unprovoked seizure have approximately 35% risk of recurrence in the subsequent 5 years, whereas\npatients with a second attack have a risk of recurrence of 73% within one year 1, 2).\nAt the start of treatment, especially for a long-term treatment policy, patients should be given explanations of their\ndisease condition, treatment period, adverse effects of drugs, etc., and given due respect of self-determination of their own\ntreatment 3-5).\nThe risk of recurrence after the first seizure is high (66–90%) in elderly people compared to young people. Therefore,\ntreatment is often started after the first seizure 6).\nWhen comparing starting drug therapy immediately after the first seizure, after the first recurrence, and after the fifth\nrecurrence, there is a slight difference among the three timings of treatment initiation in the seizure control rate during the\nsubsequent 2 years, but no difference in more long-term seizure outcome. In a study of 525 epilepsy patients (mean age 29\nyears; mean onset age 26 years; idiopathic epilepsy in 27%, symptomatic epilepsy in 29%, and cryptogenic epilepsy in 45%)\nfollowed for an average of 5 years, 37% of the patients with more than 20 seizures before starting treatment (n = 185) had\nrecurrence within one year, compared with 29% among patients with 20 or less seizures before treatment initiation, and the\ndifference was significant 4). In addition, the prevalence of persistent seizures was higher in patients with symptomatic or\ncryptogenic epilepsy than in those with idiopathic epilepsy (40% vs. 26%)\n▪ References\n1) Hauser WA, Rich SS, Lee JR, et al.

The recommended second-line drugs are phenytoin, valproate, clobazam, clonazepam, phenobarbital,\ngabapentin, lacosamide and perampanel.\nComment\nFor new-onset epilepsy, treatment with antiepileptic drug usually starts with monotherapy. The drugs are selected taking\ninto consideration the conditions of individual patients based on the diagnosis of seizure type and epilepsy. Basically,\nantiepileptic drugs are started at low doses, and the doses are increased gradually until seizures are controlled. If seizures are\nnot controlled by the first antiepileptic drug, review the diagnosis of epilepsy, check the status of compliance with drug\ntaking, and confirm whether the maximum tolerated dose has been reached. If the initial drug (first-line drug) is judged to\nbe ineffective, prescribe the next drug (another first-line drug or a second-line drug) (Table 1).\nIn February 2018, clobazam, gabapentin, topiramate, and perampanel were approved for adjunctive use with other agents\nin Japan.\n▪ References\n1) Marson AG, Al-Kharusi AM, Alwaidh M, et al.

Lamotrigine,\nlevetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, clobazam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and perampanel are recommended\nas second-line drugs. In women of child-bearing ages, drugs other than valproate are more recommended.\n(2) For absence seizures, valproate and ethosuximide, followed by lamotrigine are recommended.\n(3) F or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, valproate, clonazepam, levetiracetam, and topiramate are recommended.\nComment\nFor generalized seizures, the seizure control effect of valproate is superior to the other drugs. However, due to the adverse\neffects of valproate, including teratogenicity and effect on neonatal IQ, drugs other than valproate should be considered for\nwomen of child-bearing ages 9-11). During pregnancy, valproate should be avoided when possible, and if valproate is used, a\ndose of 600 mg per day or lower is preferable.\n▪ References\n1) Biton V, Sackellares JC, Vuong A, et al.

Phenytoin worsens tonic-clonic seizures, and gabapentin exacerbates myoclonic seizures.\nBenzodiazepines occasionally exacerbates tonic seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\nComments\nUnverricht-Lundborg’s disease is a representative disease of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME). In a large-scale\nstudy, treatment of Unverricht-Lundborg’s disease with phenytoin effectively controlled current seizures but worsened\nsurvival rate 2). Phenytoin is recommended not to be used for the treatment of PME, because it induces marked cerebellar\nataxia or deteriorates cerebellar ataxia.\n▪ References\n1) Perucca E, Gram L, Avanzini G, et al.

In such patients, we should be cautious with using multiple\nantiepileptic drugs, rapid dose increase, and high dose administration.\n(2) For patients with depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and psychotic disorder, some\nantiepileptic drugs should be avoided while use of some other antiepileptic drugs may be considered in\nindividual patient.\nComment\nSome psychiatric symptoms are caused by antiepileptic drugs, and they are sometimes overlooked 1). Antiepileptic drugs\nsuch as ethosuximide, zonisamide, primidone, high-dose phenytoin, topiramate, and levetiracetam may cause acute psy-\nchosis 1, 2). Potent antiepileptic drugs given at high doses by rapid up-titration may cause forced normalization psychosis, and\nrapid withdrawal of benzodiazepines may induce acute psychosis. Depressive state and declined mental performance\ndue to phenobarbital; depressive state due to ethosuximide, clonazepam, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam; and\nhypomania due to clobazam have been reported 1, 2). Levetiracetam has been reported to increase aggressiveness, and\nlamotrigine to cause insomnia, anxiety and irritation 2).\n· The risk of concomitant psychiatric symptoms is high in patients with intractable epilepsy, limbic seizures, and a past\nhistory or family history of psychosis 3).\n· For patients with depressive disorder, phenobarbital, zonisamide, topiramate, or levetiracetam should not be used, and use\nof lamotrigine may be considered 2).\n· For patients with bipolar disorder, use of phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, or oxcarbazepine may be considered 2).\n· For patients with anxiety disorder, lamotrigine or levetiracetam should not be used, and use of benzodiazepines or\ngabapentin may be considered 2).\n· For patients with psychiatric disorder, phenytoin, ethosuximide, zonisamide, topiramate, or levetiracetam should not be\nused 2).\n· To prevent antiepileptic drug-induced psychiatric symptoms, when adding or changing potent antiepileptic drug, do it\nover an adequately long duration and provide guidance to patients to maintain compliance with medication 1, 4).\n▪ References\n1) Matsuura M, Fujiwara T, Ikeda A.

On the other hand, a number of new antiepileptic\ndrugs are metabolized by the kidney.\nPhenytoin is the drug with the most serious concern regarding the increase in the fraction of free (non-albumin binding)\ndrug in patients with hypoalbuminemia. Although valproate shares a similar situation, the clinical significance is less marked\ncompared with phenytoin. In addition, when valproate is used in combination with phenytoin, strong binding of valproate\nwith albumin results in further increase in free phenytoin.\n▪ References\n1) Karceski S, Morrell MJ, Carpenter D.

Carbamazepine showed\na slightly higher seizure control rate, whereas lamotrigine and gabapentin were superior in terms of tolerability and lower\nmedication dropout rate 1).

Given the complicated relations as shown in Figure 1, they are one of the reasons for monotherapy recommendation.\nHowever, even with monotherapy, autoinduction of metabolic enzymes is a characteristic of carbamazepine. There is a\nconcern over the phenomenon of a decrease in blood concentration from approximately one month after treatment initiation\nor an increase in blood concentration when the drug is restarted after temporary interruption (see CQ12-4 on page 108).\nGabapentin, levetiracetam, and topiramate (200 mg/day or lower) show little interaction between antiepileptic drugs.\nDrugs that lower the epileptic seizure threshold as shown in Table 1 are commonly involved in drug interaction.\n▪ References\n1) Ikeda A.

In childhood epilepsies, many\nepilepsy syndromes have good prognosis, such as childhood absence epilepsy and benign childhood epilepsy with\ncentrotemporal spikes. Childhood epilepsy covers the onset age range of one month after birth to around 18 years\nof age.\nComment\nIn a prospective community-based study, Berg et al.1) attempted to classify 613 patients with childhood epilepsy into\nepilepsies, epilepsy syndromes and related seizure disorders. They found partial epilepsy in 58.6% of the cases, generalized\nepilepsy in 29.0%, and undetermined epilepsy in 12.4%. Regarding the proportions of epilepsy syndromes, they reported 74\ncases (12.1%) of childhood absence epilepsy, 59 cases (9.6%) of benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, 15\ncases (2.4%) of juvenile absence epilepsy, 12 cases (2.0%) of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, 24 cases (3.9%) of West syndrome,\n10 cases (1.6%) of Doose syndrome, and 4 cases (0.7%) of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In an epidemiological study conducted\nin Japan, Oka et al.2) analyzed 1,337 patients younger than 13 years with strictly defined epilepsies (excluding those with a\nfirst unprovoked convulsion or febrile seizure), and classified 907 (75.8%) patients as partial epilepsy, 268 (22.4%) patients\nas generalized epilepsy, 21 (1.8%) patients as undetermined epilepsy, with the remaining 141 (10.5%) patients as unclassifiable.\nIn addition, Wirrell et al.3) studied all 359 patients diagnosed with new-onset childhood epilepsy (0–17 years of age) in\nOlmsted County, Minnesota in 1980–2004, and classified the epilepsy of each patient based on the 2010 ILAE classification\n(see Chapter 1, CQ1-3 on page 6). As for the classification of seizure type, focal seizure accounted for 68%, generalized or\nbilateral seizures 23%, spasms 3%, and undetermined 5%. For the classification of epilepsy syndrome, 105 cases (29.2%)\ncould be classified, and they comprised benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes in 26 cases (7.2%), childhood\nabsence epilepsy in 17 cases (4.7%), juvenile absence epilepsy in 11 cases (3.1%), juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in 11 cases (3%),\nWest syndrome in 9 cases (2.5%), Doose syndrome in 2 cases (0.6%), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in 1 case (0.3%), and mesial\ntemporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis in 8 cases (2.2%).\n▪ References\n1) Berg AT, Levy SR, Testa FM, et al.

They include electroencephalogram (EEG), neuroimaging studies, and routine blood tests. Of these,\nEEG can detect epileptiform activities at a higher rate than in adults, and it is the most useful examination. MRI is\nrecommended among the neuroimaging modalities.\nComment\n1. EEG\nPrevious studies reported that epileptiform EEG abnormalities are detected in 18‒56% of children after new-onset\nseizures (compared with 13–35% in adults)1). In addition, an epidemiological study including children and adults shows that\nwe rarely detect an epileptiform abnormality after the third negative EEG examination2). The patients with epileptiform\ndischarges have epilepsy approximately two times more frequently than those with normal EEGs1). In a prospective study in\nchildren with a first unprovoked seizure conducted by Shinnar et al.3), EEG abnormalities were found in 135 (42%) of 321\nchildren studied. The EEG abnormalities comprised focal spikes in 77 cases, generalized spike-and-wave complexes in 28\ncases, slowing in 43 cases, and nonspecific abnormalities in 7 cases. The detection rate was higher in partial seizures than in\ngeneralized seizures, higher in children aged 3 years or older than in younger children, and higher in symptomatic epilepsies\nthan in idiopathic epilepsies. In the symptomatic epilepsy group, seizure recurrence was observed in 54% of 103 cases with\nEEG abnormalities, but in only 25% of 165 cases without any EEG abnormalities. EEG abnormalities, especially epileptiform\ndischarges and localized slow waves, are useful for predicting seizure recurrence. When used in combination with other\nclinical findings, EEG may play an important role in the diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome even in patients with only a single\nseizure. For example, when a child with a convulsion attack during sleep for the first time shows spikes in the centrotemporal\nregion, a diagnosis of childhood benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spike is strongly suggested, and the prognosis can be\npredicted.\n2. Neuroimaging examinations\nThere is no sufficient evidence on whether neuroimaging examination should be performed routinely after the first\nunprovoked seizure in children. If symptomatic epilepsy is suggested, neuroimaging studies are recommended, especially\nMRI. Shinnar et al.4) performed imaging examinations in 411 children with a first unprovoked seizure, and found brain\ntumor and neurocysticercosis in two children each. They enrolled the remaining 407 children in a prospective study. Among\nthem, 58 children underwent MRI examination, and abnormalities were found in 19 children (33%), including cortical\ndysplasia in six children with normal imaging findings at the initial examination. In a prospective study conducted by\nTanabe et al.5) in Japan, MRI examination was performed in children having a first seizure, and abnormal findings were\ndetected in 10 of 41 children (24.4%), including cortical dysplasia in 4 children. Even with these results, the clinical\nsignificance of the lesions shown by imaging studies should be evaluated carefully, especially for their epileptogenicity.\n3. Routine blood tests\nIn children, routine blood tests have clinical significance because the first seizure may also occur under conditions of\nhypoglycemia or electrolyte abnormalities.\nChapter 4 35\n▪ References\n1) Wirrell EC.

According to a large-scale,\nprospective, randomized, controlled trial reported from the UK, immediate treatment after onset was superior to delayed\ntreatment in terms of prompt seizure control, but there was no significant difference in the long-term outcome (remission)1).\nThere was also no significant difference in QOL such as employment status. The natural courses of the epilepsies were not\naffected by the number of epileptic seizures. Apart from controlling seizures, it is an unsolved issue in clinical epileptology\nof whether antiepileptic drug treatment also changes the natural course of epilepsy. To date, there is no clear evidence that\nantiepileptic drugs affect the natural course of epilepsy.\nOn the other hand, there is evidence that even when patients with unprovoked seizures are followed without any treatment,\nseizures do not recur in one-half of them. Therefore, if treatment is started after the first seizure, one-half of the patients\nwould be treated unnecessarily. Most clinicians start treatment with antiepileptic drugs when seizures are repeated three or\nfour times, but there are only a few studies on the short-term and long-term outcome of this policy.\n▪ References\n1) Marson A, Jacoby A, Johnson A, et al.

Medical history, onset age, triggers of seizures, and electroencephalographic findings are important for\ndiagnosis.\nComment\nMyoclonic seizures are sudden, brief, shock-like muscle jerks affecting muscles of the face, trunk and extremities. The jerks\noccur in a single muscle or several muscles together1). Usually, no loss of consciousness is associated with the seizures.\nAlthough the seizures may occur alone, they may also develop into generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures are\nreadily induced by external stimuli, especially by photic stimuli.\nJuvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) accounts for 26% of idiopathic generalized epilepsy and 5–10% of all epilepsies2).\nSymptoms suggestive of this epilepsy are (1) childhood to adolescent onset, (2) induced by sleep deprivation and alcohol, (3)\ntonic-clonic seizure or myoclonic seizure in the early morning, (4) brief absence seizure, (5) photoparoxysmal EEG response\nwith generalized 3-Hz spike-and-wave complexes or polyspike-and-wave complexes3).\n▪ References\n1) Proposal for revised clinical and electroencephalographic classification of epileptic seizures.

Carbamazepine has been reported to exacerbate generalized seizures other than generalized\ntonic-clonic seizure. For lamotrigine, physicians should strictly follow the package insert for the dosage and\nadministration, and it therefore takes a long time to up-titrate to the effective dosage. For child-bearing aged women,\nsee Chapter 13 (page 113).\nComment\nWhen 260 children with newly diagnosed idiopathic generalized epilepsy and partial epilepsy were randomly allocated to\ntreatment with valproate or carbamazepine, the efficacy did not differ significantly between the two drugs1). Valproate was\nmore effective than carbamazepine for generalized seizures (all ages)2). Carbamazepine may exacerbate idiopathic and\nsymptomatic generalized epilepsies manifesting absence and myoclonic seizures3). Zonisamide is effective for partial seizures\nand secondarily generalized seizures, but physicians should pay attention to some adverse effects including hypohidrosis and\nimpaired cognitive function in children4). Levetiracetam is also effective for partial seizures and secondarily generalized\nseizures, with only few adverse effects including teratogenicity. Lamotrigine has broad spectrum antiepileptic activities for\npartial seizures, generalized seizures, and absence seizures, with generally few adverse effects including teratogenicity; but\nnote that the prescribed dosage and administration processes have to be strictly followed.\n▪ References\n1) Verity CM, Hosking G, Easter DJ.

In the case of recurrence when valproate is used for generalized seizures\na. Generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS)\nSelect lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine†, clobazam, levetiracetam, or topiramate†, considering their\nadverse effect profiles. However, when absence seizures and myoclonic seizures coexist, we should consider the fact\nthat carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine† have a risk of aggravating these seizures.\nb. Absence seizures\nEthosuximide is recommended. If ethosuximide cannot be used, lamotrigine is recommended, although it is\nconsidered less effective than ethosuximide.\nc. Myoclonic seizure\nFor juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, levetiracetam†, lamotrigine and topiramate† are recommended. For myoclonic\nseizure complicating other epilepsies, clonazepam and clobazam are selected although the evidence is low.\n2. In the case of recurrence when carbamazepine is used for partial seizures\nSelect zonisamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, clobazam, topiramate, valproate, or gabapentin, considering their\nadverse effect profiles.\nComment\n1) There was no significant difference in effectiveness between valproate and carbamazepine in children with new-onset\ngeneralized tonic-clonic seizures or partial seizures1). In children with new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures and\npartial seizures, there were also no significant differences in efficacy among phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and\nvalproate2). In adults and children with generalized epilepsy or unclassified epilepsy randomly allocated to treatment with\nvalproate, lamotrigine or topiramate, valproate was the best in both tolerability and efficacy. As the initial treatment for\ngeneralized tonic-clonic seizures, NICE guideline 2012 recommends valproate followed by lamotrigine, and then\ncarbamazepine and oxcarbazepine†, or adjunctive therapy using clobazam, levetiracetam or topiramate† 3).\n2) In randomized controlled trials comparing valproate, ethosuximide, and lamotrigine for childhood absence epilepsy,\nvalproate and ethosuximide were superior in efficacy to lamotrigine, but there was no difference between the two former\ndrugs4, 5). However, since ethosuximide has less adverse effects compared to valproate, ethosuximide is recommended as\nthe first-line drug for childhood absence epilepsy.\n3) In a study comparing valproate and lamotrigine for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, no significant difference in seizure control\nrate was observed between the two drugs, while the rate of discontinuation due to adverse effects was lower with\nlamotrigine6). In an randomized controlled trial (RCT) for idiopathic generalized epilepsy with myoclonic seizures,\nlevetiracetam reduced myoclonic seizures at a significantly higher rate compared to placebo7). In addition, expert consensus\nstudies recommended the following drugs for myoclonic seizure, in the order of: valproate, clonazepam, and clobazam in\none paper, and valproate and lamotrigine in another paper8, 9). Based on all these studies, valproate followed by levetiracetam,\nlamotrigine, clonazepam, and clobazam are recommended. However, it should be noted that lamotrigine has a risk of\ndeteriorating myoclonic seizures in patients with Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy) and in some\npatients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\n40 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\n4) In children aged 2‒16 years with partial epilepsy and in some children with generalized epilepsy, there was no significant\ndifference in efficacy among clobazam, carbamazepine and phenytoin when used as monotherapy10). However, in Japan,\nclobazam is currently not approved for monotherapy.\n5)Lamotrigine and carbamazepine were equivalent in efficacy for partial seizures with or without generalized tonic-clonic\nseizures11). When the effects and efficacy of carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate were\ncompared in 1,721 adults and children with partial epilepsy, lamotrigine was more useful than carbamazepine, gabapentin\nor topiramate in terms of lower discontinuation rate and fewer adverse effects, and was not significantly different from\noxcarbazepine.\n6) NICE guideline 2012 recommends adjunctive use of clobazam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine,\nvalproate or topiramate12).\n*For the use of perampanel in patients aged 12 years and above, and lacosamide in patients aged 16 years and above, see\nChapter 3 “Drug Therapy for Adult Epilepsy”.\n▪ References\n1) Verity CM, Hosking G, Easter DJ.

Some subtle seizures that do not impede daily life and recur several times a year are drug resistant, but not intractable.\nEven when antiepileptic drugs fail to control seizures, if the seizure frequency is 1‒2 times a year, the patient is not indicated\nfor surgery. However, if seizure frequency is 1‒2 times a month, the patient has an intractable epilepsy in whom surgical\ntreatment should be considered.\nThe definition of drug-resistant epilepsy depends on the use situation and we have no universal definition. The ILAE\nproposed the above definition so that it can be applied to various situations1). This definition is intended not only for clinical\nsettings but also for purposes such as designing clinical trials, clinical research, and facilitating referral of the patients to\nspecialized facilities. Referral to specialized facilities is recommended if seizures are not controlled by two appropriately\nselected drugs at adequately high doses.\nThe evidence for two drug regimens was provided by a study of 1,098 adolescent or adult patients with untreated epilepsy.\nThe seizure-free rate was 50% after the first drug regimen, 13% after the second regimen of monotherapy or combination\ntherapy, but only 5% after the third to ninth regimen of monotherapy or combination therapy. Since there is very low\npossibility of achieving seizure-free status by continued drug therapy after failure of 2 regimens of antileptic drugs as\nmonotherapy or combination therapy, epilepsy uncontrollable by 2 appropriate drugs as monotherapy or combination\ntherapy can be regarded as drug resistant2).\nThe evidence of at least one year is based on community-based studies showing that one or more seizures in the past two\nyears have various impact such as psychological symptoms or disadvantages in daily life. In addition, being seizure-free for\nat least one year is a requirement for acquiring a driver’s license in many countries. However, in a long-term follow-up (2-22\nyears, median 6.1 years) study of 780 adolescent-adult patients with untreated epilepsies, out of 462 patients whose seizures\nwere controlled for more than 1 year at the time of the final observation, 74% had seizures controlled within one year, and\n11% within two years after the treatment started. In another definition, drug resistance was defined as seizures persisting\nafter at least two years of treatment, in addition to control failure with two drugs. This is because the possibility of drug\nresistance is high if seizures are not controlled after two years of treatment3).\nHowever, these definitions do not always apply to children, and there are many pediatric patients in whom seizures are\nwell controlled by three or more drug regimens. In a cohort of 613 children with epilepsy prospectively followed for 13 years\nat the longest (median 9.7 years), 128 children who did not respond favorably to two drugs were treated with the third or\nmore drugs (median 3 drugs). After treatment for 1-14 (median 10.1) years, seizures were controlled for at least 1 year during\nthis period in 57% of the patients, and seizures were controlled for more than 1 year at the final observation in 38%4).\nTherefore, for children, drug resistance must not be defined only by seizures not controlled by two drug regimens, or not\ncontrolled after 1‒2 years of treatment.\nAccording to the guideline of the Japan Epilepsy Society for the purpose of considering surgical indication, the criterion\n44 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\nof drug-resistant epilepsy is seizures not controlled after more than 2 years of treatment even with 2‒3 kinds of appropriate\ndrugs5).\nIt should be noted that there are many patients with pseudo-drug-resistant epilepsy due to misdiagnosis (see CQ5-3 on\npage 47).\n▪ References\n1) Kwan P, Arzimanoglou A, Berg AT, et al.

Among\nthem, 45% were seizure-free for one year or longer. By epilepsy classification, the seizure-free rate was 27% in symptomatic\n(with a definitive cause of epilepsy) or cryptogenic (cause of epilepsy suspected but not definite) generalized epilepsy, 82% in\nidiopathic generalized epilepsy, 35% in symptomatic partial epilepsy, 45% in cryptogenic partial epilepsy, and 11% in partial\nepilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis. Among the partial epilepsies, seizure-free rate was 20% in temporal lobe epilepsy and\n36% in non-temporal lobe epilepsy. For temporal lobe epilepsy, the seizure-free rate was 10% when accompanied by\nhippocampal sclerosis, and was 31% when not accompanied by hippocampal sclerosis. There was no difference in the seizure-\nfree rate between temporal lobe epilepsy without hippocampal sclerosis and non-temporal lobe epilepsy. The seizure-free rate\nwas markedly low in hippocampal sclerosis, dual pathology (hippocampal sclerosis + other lesions), and cerebral dysgenesis\n(11%, 3% and 24%, respectively)1).\nIn a prospective study of 550 adolescent and adult patients with partial epilepsy treated with antiepileptic drugs, 312\n(57%) patients were seizure-free for at least 1 year at the last follow-up. The seizure-free rate was 42% in patients with mesial\ntemporal sclerosis, 78% with cerebral arteriovenous malformation, 67% with cerebral infarction, 63% with brain tumor,\n57% with gliosis, 55% with cerebral atrophy, and 54% with cortical dysplasia. Patients with mesial temporal sclerosis were\nthe most intractable. There was no difference in seizure-free rate between patients with symptomatic partial epilepsy and\nthose with cryptogenic partial epilepsy2). In patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (mean age 28.6 years) observed for an\naverage of 16 years, seizures were controlled in only 5% of the patients3).\nAmong 780 adolescent and adult patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy and followed long-term after treatment initiation\n(2–22 years, median 6.1 years), 318 (41%) patients did not achieve seizure control at least for the last 12 months of follow-up.\nThese patients frequently had (1) symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsy; (2) more than 10 seizures before treatment initiation;\n(3) a family history of epilepsy, previous febrile convulsion, and traumatic brain injury; (4) nonadherence or irregular use of\nantiepileptic drugs; and (5) prior or current psychiatric comorbidity (especially depression)4). The presence of these factors\nmay predict a high possibility of drug-resistant epilepsy.\nSome autoimmune encephalitis-related epilepsies such as autoimmune limbic encephalitis and anti-NMDA receptor\nencephalitis are highly drug-resistant and require immunotherapy5). Furthermore, although not an epilepsy, psychogenic\nnonepileptic seizure is also highly drug resistant and is difficult to diagnose and treat.\n▪ References\n1) Semah F, Picot MC, Adam C, et al.

Causes of drug resistance\nIn one 2-year follow-up study of 381 children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, 75 patients (19.7%) were found to have drug-\nresistant epilepsy. Neuroimaging abnormalities, some abnormalities found in clinical neurological examination, and focal\nseizures were associated with drug resistance. Despite treatment of these patients with appropriate drugs for an average of\n11.7 years, 49% remained drug resistant, and the resistance was mostly associated with neuroimaging abnormalities1). In\nanother study, among 459 patients with childhood epilepsy treated for 2‒14 years (mean 7.5 years), 87 patients (19%) were\ndrug resistant. The factors associated with the drug resistance were age younger than 4 years, developmental delay or motor\ndeficit, brain structural abnormality, and specific epileptic syndromes2).\n2. Relation of drug resistance with epilepsy syndromes or underlying diseases3)\nIn children, there are drug-resistant epilepsies specific to age of onset4, 5). Infantile epileptic encephalopathies (including\nearly-stage myoclonic encephalopathy, Ohtahara syndrome, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, West\nsyndrome, and Dravet syndrome) and early childhood onset epileptic encephalopathies (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,\nmyoclonic encephalopathy in non-progressive diseases, and myoclonic absence seizure) are extremely drug resistant. In these\nepilepsies, seizure control is almost impossible except for West syndrome, in which seizures could be controlled in\napproximately 50% of the cases.\nAs in adults, seizures caused by localized cortical dysplasia in children are drug resistant, but some childhood-specific\nepilepsies such as epilepsies associated with unilateral megalencephaly, lissencephaly, and holoprosencephaly are markedly\nsevere and seizures cannot be controlled by antiepileptic drugs.\nAmong chromosomal abnormalities, seizures associated with ring chromosome 20 syndrome are intractable, and seizures\nassociated with 4p minus syndrome (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome) are also highly drug resistant.\nAmong neurocutaneous syndromes, seizures associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome and linear nevus syndrome are not\ncontrolled by drugs. Tuberous sclerosis is accompanied by epileptic seizures at a very high rate (approximately 85%), and\nmost cases are West syndrome. West syndrome caused by tuberous sclerosis responds well to vigabatrin, but rarely responds\nto other antiepileptic drugs.\nEpileptic seizures associated with destructive lesions in the brain caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathies such as\nencephalitis/encephalopathy, meningitis, and severe neonate asphyxia; as well as seizures associated with neurodegenerations\nin the brain such as metabolic neurological diseases and neurodegenerative diseases (including DRPLA, Krabbe disease,\nneuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and GLUT-1 deficiency) are drug resistant, and seizures related to autoimmune encephalitis\nare also drug resistant in children.\n▪ References\n1) Wirrell EC, Wong-Kisiel LCL, Mandrekar L, et al.

In the case of inappropriate choice of drugs\n(1) The most common cause is misdiagnosis of non-epileptic seizures as epilepsy, such as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures\n(PNES), syncope, and arrhythmia. (2) Inappropriate drugs are selected due to wrong diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome or\nseizure type. (3) The antiepileptic drugs are inappropriate for the correct diagnosis of seizure type or epilepsy syndrome, such\nas using carbamazepine for myoclonic seizure leading to exacerbation1).\nIn one study in which 1,590 patients underwent simultaneous EEG-video monitoring, 32.3% were found to have\npsychogenic seizures2). In another study, 46 (25%) of 184 patients treated for epilepsy did not have epilepsy, and 12 (13%) of\n94 patients who were regarded as having intractable epilepsy did not have epilepsy3).\n2. In the case of drug resistance despite using appropriate drugs\nThe cause may be due to pharmacokinetics, such as (1) the blood concentration may be low because the dose is inadequate,\nor may not be much enough because not titrating the dose to the maximum tolerable level paying too much attention to the\ntherapeutic range of blood concentration; (2) inappropriate multidrug therapy including a combination of drugs showing\ninteractions (see Table 1 of CQ 12-4 on page 109) that lower the blood concentration; and (3) occurrence of drug tolerance\n(including benzodiazepines and acetazolamide).\n3. In the case of drug resistance despite prescription of appropriate antiepileptic drugs at adequate doses\nThe causes may include (1) poor adherence due to a lack of understanding and motivation of epilepsy treatment by the\npatient or the family, or excessive anxiety over antiepileptic drugs; (2) induction of seizures by alcohol or drug abuse, and\npoor adherence; (3) inappropriate time of drug taking or irregular time of drug taking due to irregular life rhythm such as\nnight shift; and (4) lifestyle problem such as shift work causing disturbed circadian rhythm, sleep deprivation, and fatigue1).\n▪ References\n1) Kwan P, Schachter SC, Brodie MJ.

After reviewing the seizure symptoms, epilepsy\ndiagnosis and etiology of epilepsy, assess whether the case is truly drug resistant or pseudo-resistant. In the case of\npseudo-resistance, remove the causative factors (see CQ 5-4 on page 50). In the case of true resistance, review the\ndrug therapy (diagnosis, choice of drugs, dose, use of antiepileptic drugs based on pharmacokinetics, rational use of\nmultidrug combinations, etc.) and consider other treatment options such as surgery and immunotherapy.\nComment\n1. Are the choices of drug and dose appropriate?\nConfirm the seizure symptoms, medical history, situations when seizures occur, interictal EEG (sleep EEG essential), and\nbrain MRI. Examine the underlying disease (family history, past history, present illness, general physical findings, and\nneurological findings). Based on the above, determine whether the case is truly epilepsy or not, and diagnose the seizure type\nand epilepsy syndrome, and investigate the etiology of epilepsy. Next, examine the type of antiepileptic drug and dose, and\nblood concentration. Interview, gesture mimicking seizure symptoms, and video recording by family members are useful to\nconfirm seizure symptoms.\n2. Identification of pseudo-drug resistance and management\na. Differentiation between epilepsy and confounding seizure symptoms (see CQ1-4 on page 10, and CQ1-5 on page 11)\nConfirmation of seizure symptoms (from home video if possible), interview (especially the situation of seizure occurrence),\ninterictal sleep EEG, and video-EEG monitoring are useful.\nb. Review diagnosis of epilepsy, epilepsy syndrome and related seizure disorders, as well as seizure type\nThe procedures are similar to those described above (a). Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is sometimes misdiagnosed as partial\nepilepsy and treated with carbamazepine or phenytoin, which may exacerbate the seizures1).\nc. Review the choice of drug and the dose\nExamine whether the drug is appropriate for the epilepsy syndrome and seizure type (see Table 1 in CQ4-6 on page 42\nand Table 1 in Chapter 6 on page 54), whether the drug is used sufficiently (dose and blood concentration), and whether\ntolerance occurs. In the case of multidrug therapy, examine whether each drug is appropriate for the seizure type, whether\nthere is drug interaction that lowers blood concentration, and whether drugs with the same mechanism of action are used in\ncombination.\nFrom the above information, switch to the appropriate drug, up-titrate until the maximum tolerated dose with blood\nconcentration exceeding the therapeutic range, and confirm the effect. Conduct rational multidrug therapy by selecting\ndrugs appropriate for each seizure type, increase or decrease the doses considering drug interactions, and use drugs with\ndifferent mechanisms of action in the combination.\nd. When poor adherence is suspected\nConfirm the situation of drug taking (time of drug taking, missed doses), lifestyle and rhythm, as well as time and\nsituation at which seizures often occur. Monitoring blood concentration is useful for detecting habitual poor adherence.\nTo prevent lowered adherence, explain to the patient and the family about the following: (1) the nature of epilepsy from\nthe viewpoint of epilepsy syndrome and the prognosis, (2) the necessity of treatment, (3) caution in daily life, and (4)\nproperties of the drugs being taken (half-life, interaction with other drugs or foods, possible adverse effects and their\nfrequency and severity). Also, adjust the time of drug taking considering the patient’s lifestyle such as night shift.\n50 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\n3. True drug-resistant epilepsy\n(1) If MRI detects an intracranial lesion, evaluate for epilepsy surgery soon.\n(2) Select first-line or second-line drug that is deemed appropriate, and increase the dose up to the maximum tolerated\ndose. As long as adverse effects are not induced, up-titrate to blood concentrations exceeding the therapeutic range. When\nadverse effect appears, reduce the dose.\nDespite the above procedures, if seizures remain uncontrolled, conduct rational multidrug therapy considering interactions\nof antiepileptic drugs (see Table 1 of CQ12-4 on page 109) and the mechanisms of action. Add a drug that has different\nmechanism of action from the drug currently being used or a drug with multiple mechanisms of actions2). An effective\ncombination is to use a Na+ channel blocker and a GABAergic inhibition enhancer. Although the therapeutic effect is\nincreased by combining two drugs that both enhance GABAergic inhibition, or combining two glutamate receptor inhibitors\n(such as AMPA antagonist and NMDA antagonist), tolerability is often reduced. Combination of two Na+ channel blockers\nnot only has limited effectiveness, but also causes adverse effects such as exacerbating dizziness3).\n(3) Consider referral to or consultation with epilepsy specialists, measurement of autoimmune antibodies, and\nimmunotherapies (including intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and immunosuppressants), and consider surgical\nindication even though MRI shows no intracranial lesions.\n▪ References\n1) Sazgar M, Bourgeois BF.

These two outcomes are especially poor when seizures are not\ncontrolled. The rate of sudden death is also higher among people with epilepsy than the general population.\nComment\n1. Socioeconomic situation\nFor people with drug-resistant epilepsy, even when they have no intellectual problems and are in general employment,\ntheir work contents are sometimes restricted. In addition, if seizure occurs at work, they often lose their jobs. They also often\nhave difficulty in marriage. In the United States, the total household annual income of people with epilepsy is 93% of the\naverage annual income of the whole population, their unemployment rate is 25%, the high school graduation rate of those\naged 25 years and above is 64% (82% in the United States in general), and the marriage rate of those aged 19 years and above\nis 51% for men and 48% for women (63% and 59%, respectively, in the United States in general)1). This data is for all\nepilepsies including treatable epilepsies, and these figures would be even worse in people with drug-resistant epilepsy.\n2. Intellectual prognosis\nIn a study of 136 adults with various epilepsies who had uncontrolled seizures, WAIS-R was performed twice with an\ninterval of 10 years or longer. The mean verbal IQ decreased from 90.3 to 82.3, performance IQ decreased from 91.0 to 84.5,\nand full scale IQ decreased from 91.0 to 84.5, and the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizure was most strongly related\nto the cognitive decline2).\n3. Social prognosis\nAmong 102 patients (mean age 28.6, range 15‒60 years) with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome followed long-term for 10‒20\n(mean 16.3) years, 12 patients worked normally, 36 worked part-time or at a sheltered workshop, and the remaining 54 were\nunder home care or institutionalization3). Most of the 12 patients in normal employment were seizure-free for at least 1 year\nor had only tonic seizures during sleep.\nNinety-nine patients with uncomplicated childhood epilepsy (onset age younger than 16 years) followed for 27‒31 years\nwere compared with controls matched for sex, age, and birthplace. The relative risk of completing primary education only\nwas 2.1-fold, not married was 3.5-fold, no children was 3.0-fold, and unemployed was 3.8-fold4).\n4. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)\nSUDEP refers to death for which no cause can be found besides suffering from epilepsy.\nPatients with epilepsy have high mortality rate and high SUDEP rate. The standardized mortality rate for SUDEP was\n24-fold compared to the general population, accounting for 2‒17% of all-cause deaths in epilepsy patients5).\nThe mortality rate of 2,689 patients with chronic epilepsy who had been followed for 20 years was 2.05 times the mortality\nrate of the general population in Scotland matched for sex and age6). The incidence of SUDEP per 1,000 person-years was\n0.35‒1.5 cases in a population-based incidence cohort of epilepsy, but increased to 1.2‒3.8 cases in persons with chronic\nepilepsy and further to 3.5‒9.3 cases in persons with intractable epilepsy. Seizure frequency is the strongest risk factor for\nSUDEP, and other risk factors are onset at an early age and long duration of disease7). The risk of SUDEP increases if\ngeneralized tonic-clonic seizures are not controlled.\n52 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\n▪ References\n1) Fisher RS, Vickrey BG, Gibson P, et al.

For this reason, it is necessary to explain to the family (and the\npatient him/herself) about the therapeutic effects and the adverse effects of treatment with antiepileptic drugs, and to\nconsider the whole treatment policy1).\nNo randomized controlled trial (RCT) of drug therapy for idiopathic partial epilepsy has been conducted, and general\nantiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, valproate, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, gabapentin, and\nclobazam) are used2, 3). Among them, carbamazepine, valproate, levetiracetam are considered to be first-line drugs in\nconsideration of their seizure control effect and adverse effects2, 4).\nIn an RCT of sultiame for benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), which is the main idiopathic\npartial epilepsy, the seizure control rate was 40% in the control group compared with 87.1% in the sultiame group, indicating\nthe effectiveness of sultiame5). For BECTS, RCTs were conducted for sultiame and levetiracetam6) as well as for oxcarbazepine\nand levetiracetam7). In these two trials, the seizure control rates were 90.9% for sultiame versus 81.0% for levetiracetam, and\n72.2% for oxcarbazepine versus 90.5% for levetiracetam, both reported high seizure control effect.\n▪ References\n1) Oguni H.

These seizures are drug resistant and may further be complicated by mental retardation or\nother features. Too high doses of antiepileptic drugs for controlling resistant seizures may impair quality of life (QOL), and\ndrugs used to control some seizures may exacerbate other types of seizures. Therefore, it is necessary to set appropriate\ntreatment goals while reevaluating the QOL and the QOL-impairing factors1).\nExpert opinion recommends valproate as the first-line drug, followed by topiramate and lamotrigine as other first-line\ndrugs2).\nThe efficacy of lamotrigine3), topiramate4), and rufinamide5) for LGS has been studied in randomized control trials (RCTs).\nThe effective rates (50% seizure reduction rates) of these drugs when used as adjunctive therapy were 33% for lamotrigine\n(placebo 16%)3), 33% for topiramate (placebo 8%)4), and 32.7% for rufinamide (placebo 11.7%)5). A cohort study of\nzonisamide was conducted, and the effective rate (50% seizure reduction rate) when used as adjunctive therapy was 51.6%6).\nThe effectiveness of clobazam for drop attacks in LGS was studied in a RCT. The effective rate (50% seizure reduction\nrate) when used at doses of 0.2‒1 mg/kg/day was 77.6%7). Ethosuximide has been reported to be effective for atypical absence\nseizures and myoclonic seizures with few adverse effects, and is therefore recommended as a drug for these seizures8).\nA report has shown that gabapentin and carbamazepine increase seizure frequency in LGS9).\n▪ References\n1) Arzimanoglou A, French J, Blume WT, et al.

Both seizure\ntypes are treatment targets, but generalized tonic-clonic seizure is often the main treatment target because of its high impact\non QOL.\nExpert opinion for JME recommends valproate as the first-line drug1). There is no randomized control trial (RCT) of\nvalproate for JME alone, but RCT have demonstrated the efficacy of valproate for generalized epilepsies (seizure control rate\n92%), and its effect is superior to those of topiramate and lamotrigine2). Since valproate has been reported to be teratogenic3)\nand affect cognitive ability of babies4), treatment with drugs other than valproate should be given priority in child-bearing\nwomen.\nIn studies on JME, levetiracetam (seizure control rate 80%)5), lamotrigine (seizure control rate 81.9%)6), zonisamide\n(seizure control rate 38.5‒69.5%)7), and topiramate (seizure control rate 67%)8) have been shown to be effective as monotherapy.\nAmong these drugs, lamotrigine should be used carefully because it often exacerbates myoclonic seizure9). Clonazepam can\nbe effective for myoclonic seizure10).\nA report has shown that gabapentin and carbamazepine exacerbate absence seizures and myoclonic seizures, while\nphenytoin exacerbates absence seizures11). On the other hand, in a certain number of patients, a combination of carbamazepine\nand valproate is needed to control generalized tonic-clonic seizures12).\n▪ References\n1) Wheless JW, Clarke DF, Arzimanoglou A, et al.

Since valproate\nhas been reported to be teratogenic3) and affect cognitive ability of babies4), treatment with drugs other than valproate should\nbe given priority in child-bearing aged women.\nZonisamide (seizure control rate 42.6%)5), lamotrigine (seizure control rates 30‒37% at one year or 40 weeks after starting\ntreatment)6-8), levetiracetam (seizure control rate 34.2%)9), and topiramate (seizure control rate 39‒49%)8, 10) have been\nreported to be effective in controlling generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The efficacy of phenytoin and phenobarbital has also\nbeen reported, but they are not used as first-line drugs because of the adverse effect profile. As adjunctive therapy, clobazam\nalso exhibits seizure control effect (seizure control rate 10‒30%)11).\n▪ References\n1) Berg AT, Berkovic SF, Brodie MJ, et al.

When these conditions are suspected, the suspected drug should be discontinued, and\na dermatologist should be consulted. Pancytopenia, myelosuppression, and hepatic dysfunction may also be observed as\nadverse effects with allergic mechanisms. Most of the adverse effects due to these idiosyncratic reactions occur from 1‒2\nweeks to 2‒3 months after the start of treatment. Therefore, attention should be given during the early stage of administration.\nAdverse effects due to suppression of the nervous system (neurotoxic side effects) include many adverse effects such as\ndizziness, nystagmus, diplopia, drowsiness, nausea, anorexia, cerebellar ataxia, and psychiatric symptoms. Many of these\nadverse effects are dose-dependent.\nSome adverse effects are accompanied by long-term use of antiepileptic drugs, such as weight gain, hypertrichosis or hair\nloss, urolithiasis, cerebellar atrophy, and gingival hyperplasia. Enzyme inducers (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital,\nand primidone) and valproate are risk factors of osteoporosis.\nTo identify adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs, systematic adverse effect screening has been reported to be useful1).\nRepresentative adverse effects of major antiepileptic drugs are summarized in Table 1.\n▪ References\n1) Gilliam FG, Fessler AJ, Baker G, et al.

Regarding the length of seizure, if convulsive seizure persists for 5 minutes or longer, treatment should be\nstarted, and if persists for 30 minutes or longer, there is a risk of long-term consequences (ILAE 2015)2).\nComment\nIn 2015, ILAE proposed a new definition for SE as follows: “Status epilepticus is a condition resulting either from the\nfailure of the mechanisms for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms provoking abnormally prolonged\nseizures (after time point t). It is a condition, which can have long-term consequences (after time point t ), including\n1 2\nneuronal cell death, neuronal cell abnormality, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and duration of\nseizures”2).\nAlthough the traditional definition did not define the seizure duration, epileptic seizures usually terminate in 1 to 2\nminutes in most cases. It has become clear that a prolonged seizure duration is associated with drug resistance. For this\nreason, it is recommended that if the convulsive seizure lasts more than 5 minutes (t)2, 3), the diagnosis of SE should be made\n1\nand treatment should be started. In addition, animal experiments have shown that brain damage occurs if the epileptic\ndischarges continue for 30–45 minutes or more. If seizure persists for more than 30 minutes (t ), there is a risk of serious\n2\nlong-term consequences2).\n▪ References\n1) Proposal for revised clinical and electroencephalographic classification of epileptic seizures.

Established status\nepilepticus (stage 2) is defined as seizures persisting for over 30 minutes without cessation after treatment with benzodiaze-\npines. Refractory status epilepticus (stage 3) is defined as seizures persisting for more than 60–120 minutes despite treat-\nment with intravenous infusion or intravenous injection of antiepileptic drugs1). Treatment strategy depends on the\ndisease stage1-5). When seizures are not controlled even by general anesthesia and persist for more than 24 hours, the condition\nis called super-refractory status epilepticus (stage 4), for which no standard treatment strategy has been established1). Non-\nconvulsive status epilepticus treatment generally follows those for convulsive status epilepticus, but the usefulness of\ngeneral anesthesia is undetermined.\n▪ References\n1) Shorvon S, Ferlisi M.

In children, nasal / buccal administration\nand intramuscular injection of midazolam are effective (not covered by medical insurance).\nComment\nA small-scale prospective open study1) and a small-scale retrospective study2) have demonstrated the efficacy of intrarectal\nadministration of diazepam injection solution. The incidence of adverse effects including respiratory depression is low, and\nis safer compared to intravenous injection.\nWhen diazepam is administered intrarectally, the beneficial effect appears within 10 minutes in most cases1, 2). However,\nto be effective for status epileptics, rather than suppository, gel enema preparation (not available in Japan) or injection\nsolution should be used. Diazepam suppository lacks fast-acting effect, and is usually not effective in controlling on-going\nconvulsions3).\nIn addition, diazepam intramuscular injection is not recommended due to the delayed onset of effect and large variability\nof time course of effects1).\nThe use of 10 mg (for children 0.3 mg/kg) of midazolam 0.5% injection solution (note: not 0.1% injection) is effective. In\na meta-analysis of a total of 774 children and young adults, non-intravenous midazolam was more effective than intravenous\ndiazepam. In an analysis of 628 patients, buccal midazolam was more effective than rectal diazepam4). In a randomized\ndouble-blind trial of 893 patients, intramuscular midazolam (73.4%) had equivalent efficacy as intravenous lorazepam\n(63.4%)5). Another report suggests that intrarectal and intranasal lorazepam may also be effective6) (not available in Japan).\n▪ References\n1) Remy C, Jourdil N, Villemain D, et al.

However,\nlorazepam for injection is not available in Japan.\nComment\nA prospective, randomized, double-blind study showed that intravenous injection of diazepam 10 mg controlled seizures\nin 76% of the patients1). Diazepam has to be administered intravenously, not intramuscularly. Diazepam should be injected\nundiluted, because it becomes turbid when diluted with normal saline or glucose. If the first injection is ineffective, additional\ninjection can be given after 5‒10 minutes. Pay attention to respiratory depression when giving additional injection. An\nintravenous injection of diazepam usually has an anti-convulsion effect for 20 minutes2).\nA prospective randomized double-blind trial in 273 children found no difference in efficacy and adverse effects between\ndiazepam and lorazepam3), but a meta-analysis by Cochrane review of 289 cases showed that lorazepam had a lower rate of\nineffectiveness (32/130 cases for lorazepam versus 51/134 cases for diazepam, hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval\n0.45‒0.9)4). Intravenous preparation of lorazepam is not available in Japan.\nAs an alternative to intravenous diazepam, midazolam 0.1% injection may be given, and is often used for stage 1 treatment\nin children.\nIf the benzodiazepines are ineffective, proceed to stage 2 treatment.\n▪ References\n1) Leppik IE, Derivan AT, Homan RW, et al.

Therefore, fosphenytoin is easy to use in clinical practice.\nWhile intravenous phenytoin should be injected slowly, fosphenytoin can be injected at an usual speed and reaches\neffective blood concentration more rapidly. In addition, phenytoin is strongly alkaline, causing vascular pain and vascular\ndisorder, and its extravasation induces tissue necrosis. On the other hand, fosphenytoin is almost neutral, and rarely produces\nthe above adverse effects1).\nThe effective rate of fosphenytoin is reported to be 44‒97%, and a randomized study of 256 emergency patients showed\nno difference in efficacy between phenytoin and fosphenytoin1).\nPhenytoin is effective for many types of status epilepticus, except absence seizure status epilepticus and myoclonic seizure\nstatus epilepticus2). In a meta-analysis of 8 studies with 294 patients in total, the effective rate of phenytoin was 50.2% (95%\nconfidence interval 43.2‒66.1%)3). Phenytoin should be injected intravenously immediately after injection of the fast-acting\ndiazepam, because phenytoin begins to exert its effect approximately 20 minutes after administration4, 5).\nWe should follow the instructions shown below when using phenytoin. Inject undiluted phenytoin into to a relatively\nlarge blood vessel. Since there is a risk of heart failure due to cardiovascular disturbance (mainly hypotension and arrhyth-\nmia), inject the drug slowly while monitoring blood pressure, pulse and electrocardiogram. In addition, phenytoin causes\nvascular pain and purple glove syndrome due to vascular disorder at an incidence rate of 5.9%1), and may cause tissue necrosis\ndue to extravasation. Care should be taken, especially for children.\n▪ References\n1) Thomson A. Fosphenytoin for the treatment of status epilepticus: an evidence-based assessment of its clinical and economic outcomes.

As an alternative to intravenous diazepam,\nintravenous injection or continuous infusion of midazolam is an option1). Midazolam can be infused intravenously, and it\nhas a low risk of respiratory depression or cardiovascular disturbances. Moreover, because of its short half-life, midazolam\ncan be switched to other drugs (such as general anesthesia with barbiturates) when it is ineffective, without wasting time.\nIn a meta-analysis by Cochrane review, there were no significant differences in efficacy and adverse effects between\nintravenous midazolam and intravenous diazepam4).

As general anesthetic agent,\nmidazolam, propofol, thiopental or thiamylal can be used.\nComment\nRefractory status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus that is not controlled by stage 1 (such as diazepam) and stage\n2 therapeutic drugs (such as fosphenytoin).\nRefractory status epilepticus develops in 31–43% of patients with status epilepticus1). When seizures are not controlled by\nstage 1 and stage 2 therapeutic agents, we should administer general anesthetic agent immediately. When convulsive status\nepilepticus persists for more than 30 minutes, irreversible changes occur in the brain. Based on this result, it is reasonable to\nuse general anesthesia when seizures persist for approximately 30 minutes. However, there is no high quality evidence for the\ntiming to start anesthesia, which general anesthetic agent to use, the depth of anesthesia, or the duration of anesthesia. There\nare no clear recommendation standards for the above issues2).\nFor general anesthesia, midazolam (see CQ 8-2-(5) on page 72), propofol or barbiturate is used.\nPropofol has a potent antiepileptic effect and is effective in many patients. Moreover, it is fast-acting with a short half-life,\nand there is no waste of time when switching to other anesthetics. Its lethal adverse effects have been reported, but the risk\nis low when used at doses not exceeding 5 mg/kg/hour3) and terminated within 48 hours2). However, general anesthesia with\npropofol is contraindicated for children.\nThiopental and thiamylal belong to the barbiturates. Thiopental4) is fast-acting, but takes a long time to arouse after its\ncessation. The frequency of adverse effects (including hypotension and infections) during anesthesia is high. Thiamylal has a\nsimilar profile as thiopental.\nIn terms of controlling convulsive seizures, thiopental is superior to propofol and midazolam, but there is no association\nbetween these anesthetics and prognosis of disease4). In a meta-analysis by Cochrane review of only one single-blind trial of\n24 cases, there was no clear difference in efficacy between thiopental and propofol5).\n▪ References\n1) Rossetti AO, Logroscino G, Bromfield EB.

The EEG examination is\nuseful in (1) exclusion of non-epileptic seizures such as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), (2) differentiation between\ngeneralized seizures and partial seizures, (3) diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), (4) evaluation of brain\nfunction, and (5) prediction of prognosis.\nPNES is not a malingering disorder, and it may cause not only incontinence or self-injury, but also any other symptoms,\nand some patients with PNES require mechanical ventilator1, 2). EEG recording during or immediately after seizure is useful\nfor a definitive diagnosis. When examining patients with suspected PNES, record EEG as far as possible concurrent with\ntreatment (see Chapter 14 on page 123).\nFor evaluation of treatment, we should confirm not only the clinical improvements but also reduction of epileptic\ndischarges on EEG. A report demonstrated that after anesthesia was stopped, 48% of the clinically controlled patients still\nhad subtle convulsion or electrical status on EEG3).\nMany reports have shown that in status epilepticus, maintaining flat EEG3, 4) or burst suppression pattern5) with deep\nanesthesia using general anesthetic agents improves the final outcome.\nContinuous EEG monitoring is useful for the diagnosis of NCSE6, 7). EEG monitoring for over 6 hours can detect\nabnormal findings in 82% of NCSE8) (not covered by medical insurance). In addition, the occipitally dominant background\nEEG activity has been reported to be related to clinical outcome9).\n▪ References\n1) Meierkord H, Will B, Fish D, et al.

The\nabove five epilepsy syndromes are treatable by surgery (surgically remediable syndromes)1). (1) Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy\n(MTLE), especially MTLE with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) (MTLE-HS), is considered to be the best indication for surgical\ntreatment as an independent syndrome, and significant seizure control is predicted2-4). (2) For partial epilepsy, when a lesion\nis detected by diagnostic imaging and is resectable, we consider surgical treatment. Thermocoagulation surgery is effective\nfor gelastic seizures induced by hypothalamic hamartoma5). (3) Even when no lesion is depicted on MRI, surgical treatment\nmay be indicated if the epileptogenic zone can be detected by EEG and functional neuroimaging. (4) Partial epilepsy caused\nby extensive lesions in unilateral hemisphere is included as a candidate for surgical treatment. Since the arrest or regression\nof psychomotor development is often induced in patients who have intractable epilepsy with infancy or early childhood\nonset, early surgical treatment is recommended6). (5) Corpus callosotomy is effective for atonic seizures.\n▪ References\n1) Engel J Jr, Cascino GD, Shields WD. Surgically remediable syndromes. In: Engel J Jr, Pedley TA, eds.

This\ntreatment is particularly effective when localized temporal lobe lesions are depicted on MRI.\nComment\nThe results of surgical treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy have been accumulated from major epilepsy centers around the\nworld since the 1990’s1). In 2001, the superiority of surgical treatment to drug treatment was demonstrated by a randomized\ncontrolled trial (RCT)2). In 2003, the American Academy of Neurology together with the American Epilepsy Society and\nthe American Association of Neurological Surgeons published guidelines stating that “Patients with disabling complex\npartial seizures, with or without secondarily generalized seizures, who have failed appropriate trials of first-line antiepileptic\ndrugs should be considered for referral to an epilepsy surgery center”3).\nThe rate of freedom from seizures that impede daily living in patients who underwent surgery was 60–80% if MRI\ndetected localized temporal lesions related to seizures, and the rate was approximately 50% if MRI detected no lesions4).\nApart from hippocampal sclerosis, localized lesions responsible for epilepsy include benign tumors such as ganglioglioma,\ndysembryoplatsic neuroepithelial tumor and diffuse astrocytoma; cavernous malformations; and cerebral cortical dysplasia.\nPostoperative complications such as speech disturbance, memory impairment, hemiparesis, and visual field defect may\noccur, but the incidence is low5). Memory impairment after medial temporal lobe resection may involve various degrees of\nverbal memory loss if there is no hippocampal atrophy on the language dominant side, but in patients with hippocampal\natrophy and below average preoperative memory, there is no change in verbal memory after surgery3).\nTemporal lobe resection has been shown to be highly effective and safe in patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe\nepilepsy, and is an established therapy. However, it takes more than 10 years on average from diagnosis to surgery. To\naddress this issue, epileptologists in the United States performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and recommended\nthat when two trials with appropriate antiepileptic drugs failed, surgery should be conducted at an early stage without\nwaiting for years6).\nComparison between surgical and medical treatments involves an inherent limitation of the low level of evidence. The\nevaluation bias always occurs because blinding of medical and surgical treatments is impossible (see Systematic Review\nDigest on page 148). If surgical treatment is believed to be clearly effective, randomization becomes an ethical concern.\nFurthermore, we often have further difficulty in accomplishing a clinical trial since subject recruitment is challenging. This\nis shown by the fact that the randomized trial of Engel et al.6) was terminated prematurely. No comparative trials have been\nreported, probably because long-term comparative studies are especially difficult to complete. In a case series report, the rate\nof seizure recurrence after surgery was several percent per year, and the seizure-free rate was approximately 50% after 10\nyears7).\nRegarding the surgical methods, in addition to the classical standard anterior temporal lobe resection, various\napproaches to the medial temporal lobe have been proposed. Anterior temporal lobectomy is superior to selective\namygdalohippocampectomy in seizure outcome8), 9). The superiority of selective resection for postoperative cognitive function\nhas not been shown so far. For patients with high risk of postoperative memory impairment, new therapies such as multiple\nhippocampus transection, laser ablation and hippocampal electrical stimulation therapy have been proposed, and evaluation\nof these methods is awaited.\nChapter 9 77\n▪ References\n1) McIntosh AM, Wilson SJ, Berkovic SF.

The current consensus is described below, but it may be changed by the advances and widespread use of other\npresurgical examinations.\nComment\nAlthough there is no clear criterion for the indication of chronic intracranial EEG, this examination has been regarded as\na gold standard for determining the epileptogenic zone and the extent of resection area since over 50 years ago1).\nThe consensus to date for the indications includes: (1) patients with partial epilepsy diagnosed by seizure symptoms and\nother noninvasive examinations (including positron emission tomography and magnetoencephalography) even without any\nlocalized lesion detected by MRI; (2) patients with localized lesions demonstrated by MRI, which are inconsistent with the\nepileptogenic zones localized by other noninvasive examinations, or in whom multiple epileptogenic zones are suggested by\nnoninvasive examinations; (3) regardless of the presence or absence of localized lesions on MRI, patients with epileptogenic\nlesions near the functional area, in whom high-resolution focus localization and brain function mapping are required1, 2).\nChronic subdural EEG recording is often omitted when noninvasive examination results are consistent with anatomical\nfindings in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy associated with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis or partial epilepsy\nwith localized neocortical lesions. Also, this examination is often omitted in a standard extensive resection (including\ncallosotomy) (especially in children). Furthermore, this examination is usually not done before corpus callosotomy for\ngeneralized seizures.\nThere are two types of intracranial electrodes: subdural electrodes that are placed on the brain surface and depth electrodes\nplaced inside the brain. In the former case, electrodes are placed by craniotomy; and in the latter, electrodes are stereotatically\nimplanted. We have no conclusion about their superiority, and both are used when necessary3).\nEven though the required recording period has not been established, the recording is done for usually 1–4 weeks in many\ninstitutions. While it usually takes more than two weeks to perform an adequate examination, the incidence of wound\ninfection or intracranial infection increases as the placement period increases. Complications of chronic intracranial EEG\nrecording include infection, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and focal neurologic symptoms. The incidence rate is 8.3% (7.7% cured\nwithin 3 months, 0.6% prolonged)4).\nIn EEG analyses, in addition to conventional visual inspection, new analytical methods are available using signal\nprocessing for a broader frequency range. For functional brain mapping, in addition to the classical electrical stimulation\nmethod, new method is available to identify the high-frequency oscillations during a task. However, the superiority of these\nnew analytical methods has not been established5, 6).\n▪ References\n1) Nair DR, Burgess R, McIntyre CC, et al.

The “certain period” of persistent seizures is considered to\nbe one year or longer (or a period at least three times the pre-treatment interval between seizures). Earlier surgery\nshould be considered in children.\nComment\nThe ILAE1) defines drug-resistant epilepsy as “failure of adequate trials of two tolerated, appropriately chosen and used\nantiepileptic drug schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom for an\nadequate period”. An adequate period without seizures may be considered as at least one year (or a minimum of three times\nthe pre-treatment inter-seizure interval) without seizure recurrence. For adults, surgical treatment should be considered\npromptly when epilepsy is judged to be drug resistant. For childhood, early surgery is desirable considering functional and\nsurvival outcomes. The ILAE Commission on Neurosurgery2) also recommends early surgery. The goal of surgical treatment\nis not only to eliminate seizures but also to improve quality of life. Intellectual impairment and psychiatric disorder are not\nexclusion criteria for surgical indication. In children, it is known that psychomotor development improves when seizures are\ncontrolled after surgical treatment (treatable epileptic encephalopathy)3).\n▪ References\n1) Kwan P, Arzimanoglou A, Berg AT, et al.

Epilepsy syndromes in children are\ndiverse, and poorly controlled epileptic seizures may affect cognitive and behavioral developments. Therefore,\npresurgical evaluation should be performed at an appropriate timing in a specialized hospital or center.\nComment\nThe outcome of surgical treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy in children is better than that in adults, especially when a\nlesion is confirmed pathologically or by MRI1). However, there is no high-grade evidence for it, and the ILAE recommends\nthe treatment based on expert consensus2).\nThe conspicuous features of epilepsy surgery in children include a high proportion of multilobar resection and\nhemispherectomy (including callsotomy), and cerebral cortical dysplasia as a common etiology. Surgical resection of localized\ncortical dysplasia results in a high rate of seizure-free outcome3, 4).\nChildren are affected by diverse epilepsy syndromes, and poor control of epileptic seizures has a risk of worsening cognitive\nand behavioral developments. Therefore, presurgical evaluation should be performed at an appropriate timing in a specialized\nhospital or center3). Good seizure control by surgery sometimes improves developmental outcomes, especially in the case of\ninfants treated with hemispherectomy4).\nIn children with severe epilepsy showing localized lesions or hemispheric lesions, good outcome may be obtained even\nwhen EEG demonstrates extensive bilateral epileptic abnormalities.\n▪ References\n1) Téllez-Zenteno JF, Hernández Ronquillo L, Moien-Afshari F, et al.

A past\nhistory of psychiatric disease is not a contraindication for surgery under the condition that psychiatric intervention is given.\nThe frequency of de novo postsurgical psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression and psychosis, including mild\nconditions such as adaptation disorder, is 1.1‒18.2%2). Presurgical psychiatric complications frequently exacerbate or recur\nup to one year after surgery. Regular close psychiatric follow-up after surgery leads to good outcome.\nRisk factors for psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis after epilepsy surgery are residual seizures\nafter surgery and presence of a family history or past history of psychiatric condition before surgery. In surgically treated\npatients with temporal lobe epilepsy, the rate of de novo depression after surgery is 4‒18%, occurring 3‒12 months after\nsurgery and lasting for 1 to 11 months. The rate of de novo anxiety disorder occurring after surgery is 3–26%, showing a\npeak in the first month after surgery. The rate of de novo psychiatric disorders developing after surgery is 1.1%, and the\noccurrence of psychiatric disorders is not related to the postsurgical seizure control or laterality of the resected hemisphere3).\nIn patients with favorable seizure outcome (seizure-free) after surgery, the outcome of psychiatric symptoms is also\nfavorable, but in rare cases adaptation disorder may occur. A hypothesis of “burden of normality” has been proposed to\nexplain this phenomenon. It may be a kind of reaction of cured epilepsy patients to their new situation, that they should take\non various social obligations that have been neglected while they were affected by epilepsy4).\nTreatment is basically the same as the usual treatment for psychiatric symptoms. In patients who did not receive any\nexplanation about the risk of postsurgical psychiatric symptoms before surgery, the patients and families often react to or\nresist the involvement of psychiatrists after surgery. Therefore, participation of a psychiatrist in the treatment team before\nsurgery is desirable.\n▪ References\n1) Kerr MP, Mensah S, Besag F, et al.

Neither of the two RCTs mentioned decrease\nof antiepileptic drugs after surgery. Death rate did not differ between two groups.\nThe relative risk of surgical complications was 12.33 (95% confidence interval 1.67‒90.89), and was higher in the temporal\nlobe resection group. Death, memory impairment, and psychiatric symptoms were not significantly different between the\ntwo groups. Quality of life (QOL) improvement was superior in the temporal lobe resection group.\n3. Panel meeting\n3-1. What is the overall quality of evidence across outcomes?\nSince it was not possible to mask the intervention, the risk of bias was high overall in the collected studies. Bias for death\nwas considered not serious, while that for the other outcomes was considered serious and was downgraded one rank.\nInconsistency and non-directness of the results were without question and considered not serious. For imprecision, confidence\nintervals crossed the clinical decision threshold in many items, and was downgraded one or two ranks. Publication bias could\nnot be judged because of the small number of studies. Consequently, the level of evidence for the outcomes was as follows:\n“low” for seizure freedom, death, surgical complications, and quality of life improvement; and “very low” for memory\nimpairment and psychiatric symptoms. The overall level of evidence was “D (very low)”.\n* For surgical therapy, since blinding of the control group is difficult, the level of evidence is generally low.\n3-2. How is the balance between benefits and harms?\nTemporal lobe resection can be expected to control seizures. As a result, antiepileptic drugs are possibly reduced although\nit is not shown in RCT. The incidence of serious adverse effects was low. Therefore, the risk of temporal lobe resection is\nconsidered to be smaller as compared to its benefit.\n3-3. What about patients’ values and preference?\nSome patients may feel resistance in to receive invasive surgical therapy, but the beneficial effect of seizure-free produced\nby the surgery outweighs the resistance to the invasive procedure. There is perhaps no significant uncertainty or variability\nin value among the patients.\nChapter 9 83\n3-4. What is the balance between net benefit and cost or resources?\nThe medical insurance fee scale for epilepsy surgery using a microscope (including temporal lobe resection) is 131,630\npoints (as of January 11, 2018). The surgery is conducted under general anesthesia and requires neurosurgeons.\nHowever, through reducing antiepileptic drugs, decreasing hospitalization duration accompanying reduced seizures, and\nenabling more active social activities, epilepsy surgery is expected to lead to saving in the long term. For this reason, the cost\ncan be considered negligible.\n3-5. Recommendation grading\nDuring the discussions at the panel meeting, temporal lobe resection was expected to eliminate seizures, and overall the\ncost of the surgery could be considered negligible. Even taking the adverse effects into account, the surgery was supported\nby panelists.\nAt the panel meeting, many panelists supported a recommendation grade of “strong recommendation”. However, in the\nGRADE system, when the evidence level is “very low”, in general we are not able to grade “strong recommendation”. For this\nreason, the final grading was “weak recommendation”.\n4. Descriptions in other related guidelines\nIn Japan, the Japan Epilepsy Society published the “Guideline on indications for epilepsy surgery”3) in 2008, and\n“Guideline on diagnosis and surgical indications of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy”4) in 2010.\nThe “Guideline on indications for epilepsy surgery” recommends surgical treatment for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy at a\nsuitable timing, stating that “since surgical results are superior in cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with a localized\norganic lesion or with extensive lesions in unilateral hemisphere, consider surgical treatment from an early stage and do not\nmiss the timing of surgery”. The “Guideline on diagnosis and surgical indications of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy” also\nfollows the above recommendation, stating that “patients should be selected in accordance with the guideline on indications\nfor epilepsy surgery”.\nIn overseas countries, the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, the American\nEpilepsy Society, and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons published a guideline5) in 2003. The guideline\nstates that “drug-resistant epilepsy should be considered for referral to an epilepsy surgery center” and that “patients who\nmeet established criteria for an anteromesial temporal lobe resection and who accept the risks and benefits of this procedure\nshould be offered surgical treatment”.\n5. Treatment monitoring and evaluation\nMonitoring and evaluation during the perioperative period of treatment are generally performed by a neurosurgeon. After\nthis period, although a neurosurgeon is not necessarily required to monitor and evaluate the patients, follow-up and support\nfor the patients should be provided.\n6. Possibility of future research\nSome memory-preserving or minimally invasive surgery may be developed in the future. In addition, we would like to\nknow the surgical outcomes and adverse events over a longer follow-up period because the observation periods of the two\nRCTs were 1 year1) and 2 years2).\n7.

This method is covered by medical insurance, but implementation of the treatment\nrequires certification.\nComment\nVagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is used as an adjunctive accommodative treatment for patients with drug-resistant epileptic\nseizure, who are not indicated for epileptic surgery with craniotomy, or who do not respond adequately to the surgical treatment.\nThe first evidence for the efficacy of VNS was based on two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the United\nStates in the 1990s1, 2). In RCTs of therapies that require surgical treatment and implantation procedure, we usually have\ndifficulties in including an appropriate control group. However, in these two RCTs, efficacy was compared with a sham\nstimulation (low level stimulation) control group. In the sham stimulation group, an implantation procedure was performed\nin the same manner as in the treatment group, but the stimulation intensity was so low that it almost had no effect (active\ncontrol group) even though the patients feel something (Table 1). In patients aged 12 years or above with drug-resistant\npartial seizures, the mean seizure reduction rate 3 months after surgery was 25‒28% in the high-level stimulation group and\n6‒15% in the low-level stimulation group (see Systematic Review Digest on page 162). Furthermore, as a more clinically\noriented comparative study, an RCT was conducted to compare best medical therapy (BMT) alone with a combination of\nBMT and VNS (BMT + VNS), and significantly greater improvement of health-related QOL was achieved by a combination\nof VNS and BMT3).\nAlthough the effectiveness of VNS increases on long-term continued administration4, 5), RCT for long-term treatment is\ndifficult to establish because of the ethical issue, and only a limited number of patients can be recruited. The study by Ryvlin\net al.3) was initially planned for a two-year follow-up period, but the study was terminated prematurely due to difficulties in\npatient recruitment. We should take this limitation into consideration when evaluating the outcome assessment in systematic\nreview. Regarding the long-term effect, many reports have indicated that seizure reduction rate by VNS for 2 years is\napproximately 50%, and the responder rate (seizure reduction ≥ 50%) is mostly reported to be approximately 50%.\nIn addition to RCT, many investigations such as registry research and case series have demonstrated the seizure reduction\neffect of VNS5, 6), and the VNS has been established as an accommodative treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. This\ntreatment has been covered by medical insurance from 2010 in Japan, although it was delayed as compared with other countries.\nSome studies have reported the effectiveness of VNS in children or for generalized seizures7, 8). In Japan, there are no\nrestrictions regarding seizure type and age for the use of VNS. However, since RCT has not been performed, indications\nhave to be decided cautiously when used in children or for generalized seizures. Adverse effects associated with VNS include\ncough, hoarseness, throat discomfort, and swallowing disturbance, but the occurrence rate decreases during continuation\nof VNS2, 3).\nIn addition to the accommodative effects on epileptic seizures, VNS was reported to be efficacious against concomitant\nsymptoms such as cognitive dysfunction and affective disorder seen in patients with epilepsy9-11). However, it should be noted\nthat the primary end point of those studies was the effect of VNS on epileptic seizures, and the effect on concomitant\nsymptoms was not the main objective.\n86 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\n▪ References\n1) A randomized controlled trial of chronic vagus nerve stimulation for treatment of medically intractable seizures.

Although a limited number of reports have also indicated\nthe long-term efficacy of these methods and the effectiveness of other intracranial stimulation methods (hippocampus,\nparacentral thalamic nucleus, and cerebellum), evidence is not sufficient and further verification is required.\nComment\nMany patients do not achieve freedom from seizure even with appropriate drug therapies and surgical treatments. In\nrecent years, intracranial electrical stimulation therapy with implanted electrodes has attracted attention as a treatment for\nthese patients. However, as of December 2017, intracranial electrical stimulation therapy with implanted electrodes has not\nbeen approved in Japan.\nStimulation of the anterior nucleus of thalamus is performed by stimulating bilateral anterior nuclei of the thalamus\nintermittently using an implanted stimulator. For partial seizures in adults, the median seizure reduction rate is 40% after\nthree months of treatment1). The effect may last for 5 years2). Adverse events include subjective depressive symptoms and\nmemory impairment.\nResponsive stimulation of the seizure onset zone is performed by implanting deep or subdural electrodes at 1‒2 epileptogenic\nzones, which automatically detect seizure onset and initiate stimulation. For partial seizures in adults, the mean seizure\nreduction rate is 38% after 3 months of treatment3). The effect may last for 5 years4). Adverse events include intracranial\nhemorrhage and wound infection.\nMultiple institutes have reported the efficacy of hippocampal stimulation for temporal lobe epilepsy, but the number of\ncases is limited5-9).\n▪ References\n1) Fisher R, Salanova V, Witt T, et al.

Implantation of the vagus nerve stimulation device involves surgery under general anesthesia\nin an experienced hospital. After implantation, the patients need to be followed in the hospital where the\noperation was performed or other facilities by experts with experience in stimulator control.\n1. Background, priority of the problem\nIn patients with drug-resistant epilepsy in whom seizures are not controlled even after trials of two appropriate antiepileptic\ndrugs, further addition of drugs has only limited effect. Vagus nerve stimulation added to antiepileptic drug therapy is\nexpected to provide additive effect of seizure frequency reduction. Because vagus nerve stimulation is less invasive and has\nlower seizure control effect as compared with brain surgery with craniotomy, it may be selected as a treatment option in\npatients with no indication for curative neurosurgery.\n2. Comment\nEvidence summary\nOnly one randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation adjunct to best\nmedical practice (BMP) (intervention group) versus BMP alone (control group) for drug-resistant epilepsy1). We therefore\nconsidered also to use observational studies. However, because the outcomes of those studies, such as reduced seizure\nfrequency and mood change, are susceptible to placebo effect, we determined to use the single RCT.\nRegarding efficacy, the relative risk for 50% seizure frequency reduction was 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.59‒3.04),\nand NNT (number needed to treat: indicating the number of persons needed to treat to achieve the outcome for one person)\nwas 25. As for mood changes, there were no significant differences between the intervention group and control group in the\nscores for several scales: QOLIE-89 (89-item Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory), CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic\nstudies Depression scale), and NDDI-E (Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory in Epilepsy scale). Regarding mood\nchanges, the only scale showing a statistically significant difference was the 7-point evaluation scale CGI-I (Clinical Global\nImpression of Impression Important Scale), but the difference was only 0.5 (95% confidence interval 0.99‒0.01), showing a\nsmall effect. For serious adverse events, vocal cord paralysis and brief respiratory arrest occurred only in the intervention\ngroup, but were transient with no sequelae. There was no significant difference in the adverse event of dysphonia between the\nintervention group and the control group.\nIt should be noted that the selected RCT was prematurely terminated by the sponsor due to a low recruitment rate,\nbecause many study candidates did not accept randomization of the treatment. Therefore, the study may be underpowered\nfor detection of the outcome.\n3. Panel meeting\n3-1. What is the overall quality of evidence across outcomes?\nIn the study reviewed, the risk of bias was high overall, which was judged as serious for all the outcomes, and was\ndowngraded by one rank. The inconsistency of results was not downgraded because of only one study used. The indirectness\nwas judged as not serious and without any problems. As for imprecision, the confidence intervals in many analyses crossed\nthe clinical decision threshold, and it was hence downgraded by one or two ranks. As for publishing bias, there was only one\nstudy, and therefore was not downgraded. Consequently, the level of evidence for the outcomes was as follows: “very low” for\nseizure frequency ≤ 50%, serious adverse events, and dysphonia; and “low” for the other outcomes. The overall level of\nevidence was “very low”.\nChapter 10 89\n3-2. What is the balance between benefits and harms?\nSince there was only one RCT, the certainty of the effect estimate was low, and it was difficult to consider the balance\nbetween benefits and harms.\n3-3. What about patients’ values and preferences?\nThe importance of outcomes has great inter-individual differences, and it should be diverse. It should be noted that some\npatients place importance on the reduction of seizure frequency, while others regard the risk of adverse effects to be more\nimportant.\n3-4. What is the balance between net benefit and cost or resources?\nThe electrode implantation for VNS surgery is conducted under general anesthesia. Vagus nerve stimulation is covered by\nmedical insurance, and the medical insurance fee scale for implantation is 24,350 points, and that for exchange is 4,800\npoints (as of January 11, 2018). The reoperation should be done once every few years for replacement of the power generator\nbecause of degradation of the condenser. Considering the effectiveness for refractory epilepsy and the above-mentioned\nfactors, the cost was judged to be moderate.\n3-5. Recommendation grading\nDuring the discussions at the panel meeting, considering the moderate burden and cost, and the few alternative treatment\noptions available, the panelists concluded that it was reasonable to use this treatment method despite a certain amount of\nharm, burden and cost. The unanimous decision was “to propose implementing vagus nerve stimulation for drug-resistant\nepilepsy”. As an additional consideration, the patients’ families at the panel meeting expressed the following opinion: “We\ndesire to overcome social constraints. If there is any method to solve this, please include it as one of the options.”\n4. Descriptions in other related guidelines\nIn Japan, the “Practice guideline of vagus nerve stimulation therapy for epilepsy”2) was published by the Japan Epilepsy\nSociety in 2012, which states that “VNS has accommodative effect on drug-resistant epileptic seizures [recommendation\ngrade A]”. Also, the American Academy of Neurology released a guideline update entitled “Vagus nerve stimulation for the\ntreatment of epilepsy” in 2013. This guideline update describes the possibilities of the effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation\nappearing several years after VNS operation, the effectiveness in children [rate of > 50% seizure reduction: 55% (95%\nconfidence interval 50‒59%)], and an increased risk of infection in children compared to adults [odds ratio 3.4 (95%\nconfidence interval 1.0‒11.2)].\nAccording to the guidelines in Japan and overseas and the recommendation from the ILEA, the indication for vagus nerve\nstimulation is, in principle, patients who have no indication for curative neurosurgery2-4).\n5. Treatment monitoring and evaluation\nVagus nerve stimulation treatment requires adjustment of the stimulation conditions, management of complications, and\nsolving equipment troubles. Epilepsy specialists or doctors trained by the specialists should perform monitoring and\nevaluation after the operation based on expert knowledge.\n6. Possibility of future research\nThe RCT reviewed for this CQ had high risk of bias. Therefore, it is desirable to have more RCTs with better quality. In\naddition, further research focusing on how to identify good responders and the effects on status epilepticus is needed in the\nfuture.\n7.

Background, priority of this issue\nThe efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation is known to depend on the stimulation conditions. The intensity of stimulation\nshould be adjusted while monitoring its therapeutic effect and adverse effects. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether\nhigh intensity stimulation or low intensity stimulation is superior when conducting VNS.\nIn addition, as mentioned in CQ 10-1 “Should vagus nerve stimulation therapy be added to drug therapies for drug-\nresistant temporal lobe epilepsy?”, we have difficulty in performing comparison between real VNS and sham VNS (with no\nstimulation). Therefore, there is an increase in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using low intensity stimulation as sham\nstimulation (placebo stimulation or pseudo-stimulation) to compare with high intensity stimulation.\nThere is one Cochrane Review1) on a similar clinical question. This review shows that high intensity stimulation has\nsuperior therapeutic effect, while treatment withdrawal is rare both when using high and low intensity stimulation.\n2. Comment\nEvidence summary\nThere were 4 RCTs that examined the efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy2‒5).\nFor efficacy, the relative risk for seizure frequency ≤ 50% was 1.74 (95% confidence interval 1.14‒2.65) and NNT (number\nneeded to treat: indicating the number of persons needed to treat to achieve the outcome for one person) was 10. For adverse\nevents, low level stimulation was significantly superior in dysphonia and hoarseness (relative risk 2.06, 95% confidence\ninterval 1.34‒3.17) and dyspnea (relative risk 2.43, 95% confidence interval 1.29‒4.57). Treatment withdrawal, cough, and\npain did not differ significantly between high level and low level stimulations.\n3. Panel meeting\n3-1. What is the quality of evidence about the overall outcomes?\nIn all the studies collected, the risk of bias was low overall, and the level was not downgraded for all the outcomes. For\ninconsistency of the results, I was 32% for only dysphonia / hoarseness. Since the effect estimate differed between studies,\n2\nheterogeneity was considered high. Inconsistency was thus considered serious and was downgraded one rank. There was no\nproblem with indirectness, and was judged not serious. As for imprecision, the confidence intervals in many analyses crossed\nthe clinical decision thresholds, and hence was downgraded by one or two ranks. Regarding publication bias, there were only\nfour studies, and therefore was not downgraded. Consequently, the level of evidence for the outcomes was as follows:\n“moderate” for seizure frequency ≤ 50%, cough, and dyspnea; “low” for treatment withdrawal, dysphonia / hoarseness, and\npain. The overall level of evidence was “low”.\n92 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\n3-2. What is the balance between benefits and harms?\nHigh level stimulation was superior to low level stimulation for the outcome of seizure frequency ≤ 50%. Among the\nadverse events, dysphonia/hoarseness and dyspnea showed lower rates in low level stimulation, but since there was no\nsignificant difference in treatment withdrawal between two groups, there must be few adverse events serious enough to cause\ntreatment withdrawal. According to expert opinion, many adverse events are reversible and can be controlled by adjusting\nthe stimulation current intensity. Taken together, we decided that high level stimulation is probably superior in terms of the\nbalance between benefits and harms.\n3-3. What about patients’ values and preferences?\nWe concluded that there is probably no significant uncertainty and variability in patient’s values and preferences because\nhigh level stimulation is more effective than low level stimulation, and although adverse events are more prevalent in high\nlevel stimulation, they are reversible and can be controlled by adjusting the stimulation current.\n3-4. What is the balance between net benefit and cost or resources?\nAdjustment of stimulation intensity can be done by placing the programming wand over the subcutaneously implanted\ngenerator; thus resources and costs are negligible. However, reoperation is needed every few years to replace the generator\nwhen the battery runs out of power. Battery consumption is higher for high level stimulation than for low level stimulation.\nBased on these, it was decided that high level stimulation costs moderately more as compared to low level stimulation.\n3-5. Recommendation grading\nIn the discussions at the panel meeting, high level stimulation was considered superior in efficacy, and adverse effects were\nacceptable because most of them were presumably at a level that would not cause treatment withdrawal. As for burden and\ncost, high level stimulation was expected to consume more battery power, requiring more frequent generator exchange.\nBased on the above arguments, despite considerable adverse events that did not cause treatment withdrawal as well as the\nincreased burden and cost, we finally unanimously recommended using high level stimulation, considering the highly\nanticipated seizure control effect.\n4. Descriptions in other related guidelines\nIn Japan, the “Guideline on implementation of vagus nerve stimulation therapy for epilepsy”6) was published by the Japan\nEpilepsy Society in 2012, which states that “In principle, initiate VNS two weeks after implantation. Start with low\nstimulation intensity and then gradually increase the intensity while monitoring the adverse effects [recommendation grade C]”.\nIn 2013, the American Academy of Neurology released a guideline update entitled “Vagus nerve stimulation for the\ntreatment of epilepsy”7). There is no recommendation for high level or low level stimulation in that guideline. However, it\nstates that whether stimulation at a higher frequency is more likely to reduce seizures than usual stimulation remains\nunknown.\n5. Treatment monitoring and evaluation\nFor adjusting stimulation intensity, we need a system which is capable of managing complications and coping with\nequipment troubles.\n6. Future research issues\nFurther research on the optimal intensity of stimulation is needed. In addition, other than stimulus intensity, there is no\nRCT on supplementary techniques such as magnet stimulation, which will be a future research subject. It is also desirable to\nelucidate the mechanisms underlying the subgroup with high response and develop evaluation methods to identify these\nsubjects.\n7.

Although much evidence has been\naccumulated, there is no clear consensus on the timing of treatment termination.\nIn children, some epilepsy syndromes have good prognosis (= idiopathic partial epilepsy). To avoid adverse effects of long-\nterm treatment with antiepileptic drugs on cognitive and behavioral development, the benefits of treatment termination are\ngreat. In adults, such subgroup with good prognosis has not been reported, and the risk of seizure recurrence by drug\ntermination is higher than in the case of childhood-onset epilepsy1). Because social factors such as employment and driving\nlicense have great impact on the decision in adults, more careful consideration is required. In women whose seizures are in\nremission, a desire of child-bearing is a good opportunity to consider treatment termination. If seizure recurs in the process\nof treatment withdrawal, the seizure is controlled by restarting therapy in most cases, although the seizure control may be\ndifficult in some patients2). We should make a final decision on treatment termination individually by comprehensively\nconsidering various conditions of each patient (in particular, the presence or absence of a poor prognostic factor) together\nwith respect for the intentions of the patients and their families.\nAs for the timing of treatment termination in children, there is a Cochrane review that compared an early treatment\nwithdrawal group (seizure remission for less than 2 years) and a late treatment withdrawal group (seizure remission for more\nthan 2 years)3). In this analysis, the early treatment withdrawal group had a higher risk of seizure relapse than the late\ntreatment withdrawal group, with a relative risk of 1.32 (1.02–1.70). Particularly, in patients with partial seizure or EEG\nabnormality, the risk of relapse was even higher; the relative risk of early withdrawal was 1.52 (0.95–2.41), and that of late\nwithdrawal was 1.67 (0.95–3.00). There is no reliable evidence on generalized seizures. In children, there is little risk of\nrelapse if treatment is terminated after 2 years or longer of seizure remission.\nIn adults, there is no evidence that compares early and late treatment termination. According to the results of a randomized\ncontrolled trial of 1,013 adult epilepsy patients who had seizure remission for more than 2 years, the complete remission rate\nwas 78% in the patients who continued treatment, and 59% in those who withdrew treatment after 2 years of follow-up4).\nThe most important factor influencing seizure relapse was the duration of seizure remission.\n▪ References\n1) Berg AT, Shinnar S.

Finally the above references were included.\n96 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\nCQ 11-2\nDoes the risk of seizure recurrence differ depending on seizure\ntype, epilepsy type, or epilepsy syndrome?\nSummary\nThe risk of seizure recurrence differs depending on epilepsy syndrome.\nComment\nAccording to a prospective study on treatment termination in 264 children with epilepsy by Shinnar et al.1), seizures\nrecurred in 95 children (36%) during the follow-up period (average 58 months). In this study, among the epilepsy syndromes,\nno recurrences occurred in 14 children with idiopathic partial epilepsy (benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal\nspikes, benign Roland epilepsy), while seizures recurred in all 4 children with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)2).\nMeanwhile, in a long-term follow-up (median 44.6 years) study of 66 patients with JME, 39 patients (59.1% of all patients)\nremained seizure-free for over 5 years (22.9 ± 10. 9 years), 11 of whom (16.7% of all patients) had no antiepileptic drugs for\nover 5 years3). Thus, the results are inconsistent among reports.\nThe above findings suggest that the diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome is critical when considering termination of treatment.\nHowever, there are few epilepsy syndromes in which a definite prognosis can be predicted. For the other epilepsy syndromes,\nthe risk of seizure relapse is relative, and evidence is poor. In addition, many patients cannot be classified under one specific\nepilepsy syndrome. At least, the recurrence rate is higher in symptomatic epilepsy than in idiopathic epilepsy [relative risk\n1.81 (1.21–2.70)]1).\nThere is not enough evidence on the risk of seizure recurrence for each of the seizure types. According to a study from\nJapan that analyzed the recurrence and clinical features of 556 patients with childhood-onset epilepsy who discontinued\nantiepileptic drug therapy, 80 patients (14.4%) had recurrence, and the rate was especially high in those who stopped drugs\nafter adolescence2). By epilepsy type, the rates were high in adolescent- or adult-onset idiopathic generalized epilepsy (31.3%),\nsymptomatic localization-related epilepsy (25.2%), and cryptogenic or symptomatic generalized epilepsy (19.2%).\n▪ References\n1) Shinnar S, Berg AT, Moshé SL, et al.

There were several studies in children. However, no conclusion could be derived because of issues such\nas deficient methodology and insufficient sample size. Even in children, there is no evidence that can be reflected in guideline.\nIn principle, we should taper the dose gradually. Abrupt cessation of the antiepileptic drugs has the risk of causing\nunexpected rebound seizure or status epilepticus. Especially, phenobarbital and clonazepam should be tapered carefully.\n▪ References\n1) Ranganathan LN, Ramaratnam S. Rapid versus slow withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs.

The risk of recurrence in the first year after tapering of antiepileptic drug was\n0.25 (0.21–0.30) and the risk of recurrence in the second year was 0.29 (0.24–0.34). The risk factors were as follows.\nAdolescent onset epilepsy had a higher recurrent risk compared to childhood onset epilepsy [relative risk 1.79 (1.46–1.81)].\nAdult onset epilepsies had a higher recurrent risk compared to childhood onset epilepsies [relative risk 1.34 (1.00–1.81)].\nSymptomatic epilepsy had a higher recurrent risk compared to idiopathic epilepsy [relative risk 1.55 (1.21–1.98)]. Especially,\nsymptomatic epilepsy with motor symptoms had a higher risk of recurrence compared to idiopathic epilepsy [relative risk\n1.79 (1.13–2.83)]. Patients with abnormal EEGs had a relative risk of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.79) compared to those with\nnormal EEGs. There was no adequate evidence regarding the degree of abnormalities in EEG.\nIn a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 1,013 adult epilepsy patients who had been seizure-free for more than 2 years,\nthe risk of recurrence was higher in patients who took two or more drugs or those with a history of tonic-clonic seizure2).\nBased on this study, a prognostic index for recurrence of seizures after remission of epilepsy was developed3). A study on the\nconsequences of treatment termination in adult epilepsy pointed out that recurrence rate was higher in patients with\nneurological signs4).\nAccording to a review on recurrence after treatment termination in adults and children5), seizures remitted again in most\nof the patients by restarting the drugs, but in 19% of the patients (mean of 14 studies, 95% CI: 15–24%), remission was not\nobtained by resuming the drugs, and 23% of them became refractory. The factors inducing intractable recurrence included\nsymptomatic etiology, partial epilepsy, and cognitive impairment.\n▪ References\n1) Berg AT, Shinnar S.

Serum concentrations of\nantiepileptic drugs should not be monitored routinely without intended purposes. However, they should be measured when\nthere are clinical needs (Table 1)1).\nThe reference range of serum concentrations of a certain drug is not the same as its therapeutic range. The lower limit of\nthe reference range of serum concentrations is the concentration being more likely to produce an insufficient therapeutic\neffect, and the upper limit is the concentration being more often associated with adverse effects. That is, the serum\nconcentrations of antiepileptic drugs within the reference range (so-called effective serum concentrations) indicate that\nthey are expected to be effective with fewer adverse effects in most of the patients1).\nThe therapeutic range of serum concentrations for a certain patient is the range within which that patient has the best\nseizure control. In most of the patients, the therapeutic range is within or overlaps with the reference range. However,\ntreatment may be effective even when the serum concentration is lower than the reference range in some cases, or conversely\nmay be effective only when the concentration is higher than the reference range in other cases, because of large inter-\nindividual variability of the therapeutic range. Therefore, it is important to know the therapeutic range for each patient. The\ndose should not be increased if the patient remains seizure-free at serum concentration lower than the reference range. On\nthe other hand, the dose might be increased to above the reference range if the patient has residual seizures without any\nadverse effects. The reference range of serum concentration differs depending on age, epilepsy syndrome, and seizure type1, 2).\nThe reference range is determined based on the lowest serum concentration (the trough value, which is measured before\ndrug taking in the morning). However, it is difficult to measure the trough value in outpatient clinic, and serum concentration\nmeasured at our clinics is usually higher than the trough. Therefore, it is not a concern if the measured value exceeds the\nupper limit of the therapeutic range. We should interpret the blood concentration considering the blood sampling time, the\ndrug taking time, and the time of maximum concentration (T ) of each drug (Table 1 in CQ 12-2 on page 104).\nmax\nAntiepileptic drug exists in two forms in the blood: a protein-bound form and a free form. In patients with hypoproteinemia,\npregnancy, hepatic disorders or renal disorders, the amount of drug in the free form is larger than that in healthy subjects\neven when the measured serum concentration is the same, and the efficacy and adverse effects are not the same as in normal\ncontrols. Although the free form possesses antiepileptic effect, measurement of free form is not covered by medical insurance.\nIn general, the total serum concentrations of antiepileptic drugs, including both protein-bound form and free form, are\nmeasured and recorded.\nChapter 12 101\n▪ References\n1) Patsalos PN, Berry DJ, Bourgeois BFD, et al.

Serum concentration monitoring is useful for these drugs. However, for\nsome other drugs, the serum concentration monitoring is not very useful because the reference ranges have not\ndetermined for them or they show remarkable fluctuations in serum concentration (Tables 1 and 2)1-5).\nComment\nBecause there are large interindividual variabilities in epileptogenesis and response to a given antiepileptic drug, it is\ndifficult to find a general therapeutic range of serum concentrations applicable to all patients. However, it is known that\nthere exists a range of serum concentrations at which seizures are controlled and dose-dependent adverse effects are rarely\nseen in most of the patients. This range is called the “reference range” (so-called effective blood concentration).\nEven for drugs with no established general reference ranges, serum concentration measurement is useful for comparisons\nwithin an individual patient. Benzodiazepines play a role as an anti-convulsant by binding with benzodiazepine receptors\nin the brain. Because the number of benzodiazepine receptors varies from person to person, it is difficult to determine the\nreference blood concentration range for all persons. The reference ranges for clobazam, nitrazepam and diazepam have not\nbeen reported. However, repetitive serum concentration measurements in one patient are useful for monitoring adverse\neffects such as drowsiness in that patient.\nPhenytoin is a drug showing big fluctuations in serum concentration, which requires attention. Because of the non-linear\nrelationship between dosage and serum concentration and the narrow therapeutic window, measurement of serum\nconcentration is critical for setting the optimal dosage. Especially, a rapid rise in serum concentration occurs at high doses1).\nThe serum concentration of lamotrigine decreases drastically when used concomitantly with enzyme-inducing drugs\n(phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and primidone), increases greatly when used in combination with valproate, and\ndeclines significantly during pregnancy. Serum level of carbamazepine decreases within 1–3 months after start of treatment,\ndue to enzyme self-induction. Therefore, serum concentration has to be monitored shortly after treatment initiation.\n▪ References\n1) Shorvon S, Perucca E, Engel J Jr eds. The treatment of epilepsy, 4th edition.

Dialysis reduces serum drug concentrations.\nComment\nAntiepileptic drugs are mainly metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidney. But the ratio of hepatic metabolism\nand renal excretion varies depending on the drug. In patients with liver or kidney disorders, pay attention to the increase in\nserum concentrations of antiepileptic drugs, bearing in mind the metabolism and excretion routes and the ratio of hepatic\nmetabolism and renal excretion for each drug. Then, the doses should be reduced if necessary. For drugs that are metabolized\nby the liver, serum concentrations do not change markedly in acute hepatitis since metabolic enzymes do not decrease, but\nserum concentrations rise in cirrhosis because metabolic enzyme and hepatic blood flow are both reduced. In patients treated\nwith hemodialysis, the blood levels of some drugs decrease, therefore consider dose increment1) (Table 1)2-4).\n▪ References\n1) Singh G.

Conversely, when an antiepileptic drug is being added or removed, pay attention to the\npossibility that the therapeutic effects of other drugs may alter, which may result in some changes in comorbid\nsymptoms.\nComment\nDrug interactions include interactions between antiepileptic drugs (Table 1)1-3), interactions between antiepileptic drugs\nand psychotropic drugs (Tables 2 and 3)1-5), and interactions between antiepileptic drugs and general drugs other than\npsychotropic drugs (Tables 4 and 5)1-5). Pay special attention when patients are complicated with psychiatric disease or\ndevelopmental disorder, or elderly people taking various drugs because of comorbidities.\nAmong antibiotics, clarithromycin and erythromycin inhibit the metabolism of carbamazepine, resulting in a large\nincrease in serum concentration of carbamazepine, causing dizziness, vertigo, and severe drowsiness. Carbapenem antibiotics\n(panipenem‒betamipron, meropen, imipenem‒cilastatin, doripenem, biapenem, tebipenem) are contraindicated when\ntaking valproate, as they significantly lower the serum concentration of valproate.\nFor antithrombotic drugs, warfarin used with phenytoin mutually increase the serum concentrations of each other, and\nthe blood level of rivaroxaban is lowered by carbamazepine, phenytoin or phenobarbital (see CQ 3-8 on page 30).\n▪ References\n1) Shorvon S, Perucca E, Engel J Jr eds.

Specifically, encourage adolescents to understand the basic and\npractical knowledge regarding pregnancy and childbirth as well as the knowledge about epilepsy including daily life\nand importance of treatment. Also, recommend planned pregnancy and childbirth to make these life events possible\nwith the lowest risk. In patients who need to continue antiepileptic medication, it is desirable to select a drug with\nlower teratogenic risk and conduct appropriate dose adjustment to control seizures before pregnancy.\nComment\nFor women of childbearing age, it is desirable for the attending doctor to comprehensively assess the patient’s capability of\ndaily living based on the severity of epilepsy, environmental factors, and presence or absence of coexisting disability, and\ndiscuss with the family members, pediatrician and other health personnel to make a reasonable decision about the possibility\nof pregnancy and childbirth and to develop a plan for medication adherence1-3). Specifically, health professionals should\nprovide advice and guidance to all women with childbearing potential starting from adolescence (junior high school\nstudents), at the timings appropriate to women’s life cycle such as marriage and pregnancy, and recommend planned\npregnancy and childbirth with strengthened cooperation from the family.\nRegarding antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy and childbirth, we should be careful with the following points:\n(1) prescribe monotherapy in principle, (2) use the lowest required dose, (3) select AED with as low teratogenicity as possible,\nand (4) watch out for fluctuation in blood concentration of AED during pregnancy2, 3). Pay attention to the change in seizure\nfrequency at each stage of pregnancy and childbirth, and aim at optimal AED therapy considering the balance between\nseizure control and reduction of risk to pregnancy and childbirth. In addition, give detailed explanations in advance on\ngeneral precautions concerning pregnancy and childbirth, effects of AED on fetus and neonate, the course after childbirth,\ngenetic inheritance of epilepsy, and development of the child. Table 1 summarizes the measures to be taken concerning\npregnancy and childbirth.\nAlthough there is no clear difference in the rate of infants with congenital malformations between women with epilepsy\nnot taking AEDs and the general population4, 5), the frequency of congenital malformations in infants born from women\ntaking AEDs during pregnancy is 4‒10%, which is roughly 2‒3 times higher than the frequency of 2‒5% in the general\npopulation. The teratogenic risk varies depending on the AED being taken2, 5, 6). On the other hand, AEDs taken when not\npregnant or AEDs taken by male patients have little effect on the fetus2).\nThe types of congenital malformation are similar to those found in the general population, with high frequencies of cleft\nlip, cleft palate and cardiac anomalies. There are no clear differences among AEDs for minor anomalies, with one exception\nof spina bifida which is more often induced by valproate and carbamazepine2).\nWhen using oral contraceptives for planned pregnancy, explain their interactions with AEDs (phenobarbital, phenytoin,\ncarbamazepine, and lamotrigine reduce the effect of contraceptives). We should recommend the patients to consult with an\nobstetrician or gynecologist for proper guidance about pills containing estrogen of 50 μg or more and other contraceptive\nmethods2, 7).\nFurthermore, the experience of pregnancy and childbirth has great significance for women (and their families) in their\nlifetime. Therefore, we should follow the patients always considering psychological features.\nChapter 13 113\nIn clinical practice, we may use charts such as that shown in Figure 1 to highlight points that require special attention at\neach stage of pregnancy, and also the drug adjustment plan.\n▪ References\n1) Winterbottom J, Smyth R, Jacoby A, et al.

Also, select drugs\nwith careful consideration for the risk of teratogenicity and cognitive impairment in children as well as the efficacy\nfor seizure control. Also pay attention to dose adjustment.\nComment\nIn antiepileptic drug treatment, multidrug therapy has higher risk for teratogenicity than monotherapy, and the rates and\ntypes of malformation also vary depending on the types of drugs used in combination1-3). When antiepileptic medication is\nneeded during pregnancy, aim at monotherapy as far as possible from before pregnancy and select drugs with low\nteratogenicity risk. The risk of major malformations for various antiepileptic drug are shown in Table 13). Levetiracetam and\nlamotrigine have a low incidence of congenital malformation when used as monotherapy3-5). Carbamazepine also has a\nrelatively low induction rate of malformation. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, and topiramate have slightly higher malformation\ninduction rates4). Valproate has a higher malformation induction rate than the other drugs.\nWe should take note of the following point: even for antiepileptic drugs with low teratogenic risk when used alone, when\nthese drugs are used in combination, the teratogenic risk increases depending on the combination2, 4, 6). For polytherapy,\nvalproate, phenytoin, and phenobarbital are known to be drugs that increase the risk of teratogenicity when used in\ncombination2, 6). Study has also shown that the teratogenic risk is increased when phenytoin or carbamazepine is used in\ncombination with certain drugs including barbiturates (such as valproate + carbamazepine, and phenytoin + primidone +\nphenobarbital)2).\nIn children born from a mother taking valproate during pregnancy, decrease of IQ (full scale IQ, especially verbal IQ)\nwas found in a dose-dependent manner (especially at high doses of 1,000 mg/day or higher)7). The incidence of autism\nspectrum disorders also increased by prenatal exposure to valproate8). When using valproate, in addition to the high\nteratogenic risk, the risk of cognitive dysfunction and behavioral disorder in children should also be noted. When valproate\nneeds to be taken unavoidably, we should prescribe it at a dose of 600 mg/day or lower as much as possible7, 9). Use of a\nsustained release formulation is desirable aiming to stabilize blood concentration2). International guidance also recommends\nthat caution should be taken in the decision to prescribe valproate to pregnant women9).\nRegarding perampanel and lacosamide that have been launched on the market recently in Japan, there is currently\ninsufficient data concerning human pregnancy and childbirth.\n▪ References\n1) Borgelt LM, Hart FM, Bainbridge JL.

In particular, when valproate or carbamazepine\nis administered, supplementation of folic acid at an appropriate dose (0.4‒0.6 mg/day)3, 4) is desirable to reduce the risk of\nneural tube closure defect. It has also been reported that folic acid mitigates the adverse effect of antiepileptic drugs on IQ\nof children5).\nFor administration, use of ready-made folic acid preparations or multivitamin preparations containing folic acid may be\nconsidered1, 3).\n▪ References\n1) Wilson RD; Genetics Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada and The Motherrisk Program.

For example, serum concentration of\nlamotrigine may decrease to approximately 40% of the pre-pregnant level1, 2). Even though levetiracetam has a low serum\nprotein binding rate, its serum concentration may decrease by 50% or more during pregnancy3, 4). Therefore, it is necessary\nto prevent the attenuation of seizure control effect of drugs by adjusting the doses appropriately based on serum concentrations\nmeasured at various appropriate times during pregnancy and at childbirth, using the optimal concentrations of antiepileptic\ndrugs before pregnancy as the baseline level. On the other hand, it is important to prevent the adverse effects due to increase\nin serum concentrations after childbirth.\nAttention should be paid to the interpretation of serum concentrations of protein-bound drugs such as phenytoin and\nvalproate, because even when the total blood concentration shows a low value, the concentration of free drug may be\nincreased due to decreased serum protein during pregnancy. Since the therapeutic effect of antiepileptic drug is mainly\nprovided by the free drug, dosage should not be increased unnecessarily even when the total serum concentration decreases.\nIf a reduction of free drug concentration is confirmed and seizures worsen despite good medication adherence, then consider\nincreasing the dose of the drug5).\n▪ References\n1) De Haan GJ, Edelboek P, Segers J, et al.

Their frequencies are low and statistical figures are unknown1-3). There\nare few reports on premature rupture of membrane and umbilical cord abnormalities as complications at delivery. Over\n90% of mothers affected by epilepsy have normal pregnancy and delivery.\nAccording to a recent systematic review, the rates of complications including spontaneous abortion, preterm labor,\nperinatal hypertension, and postpartum hemorrhage, as well as the proportion requiring caesarean section were slightly\nhigher in mothers with epilepsy than control mothers, but the incidence of events requiring intensive care was not different\nbetween these two groups4).\n▪ References\n1) Kaplan PW, Norwitz ER, Ben-Menachem E, et al.

In general, there is no indication for caesarean section, but\ncaesarean section may be conducted depending on concomitant symptoms3). Vacuum-assisted delivery should be avoided3).\nGuide patients to continue regular drug taking as far as possible until birth1-4).

However, pay attention to the fact that\nantiepileptic drugs are transferred from maternal blood to breast milk at different rates1-3).\nWhen breastfeeding, observe symptoms in neonates such as withdrawal seizures, somnolence, hypotonia, and poor\nsuckling, considering the transfer rate of the antiepileptic drug to breast milk and the half-life of the antiepileptic drug in\nthe infant3). When these symptoms appear, manage in a flexible manner such as refraining from breastfeeding and measuring\nthe serum concentration in the neonate3). Table 1 shows the breast milk transfer rates of various antiepileptic drugs.\nIn any case, make realistic decision about breastfeeding based on a comprehensive assessment giving priorities to the\nchild’s mental and physical growth and the mother’s wish. In addition, during the breastfeeding period, provide adequate\ncare and guidance on daily life, including sleep deprivation and fatigue due to childcare.\n▪ References\n1) Harden CL, Pennell PB, Koppel BS, et al.

PNES are found in 5‒20% of patients who first visit\na hospital for suspected epilepsy, and in 15‒30% of patients diagnosed with intractable epilepsy with an indication for\nsurgery1). The male to female ratio varies depending on the subject population; PNES are female-dominant in patients with\nneither concomitant mental retardation (intellectual disability) nor epilepsy, but show no definite gender difference in\npatients with concomitant mental retardation or epilepsy. The frequencies of concomitant mental retardation vary from 17\nto 37% depending on report. In PNES with concomitant epileptic seizures or mental retardation, direct inducing factors are\noften present. Therefore, we should take detailed history of the patient’s living conditions and focus on any changes in\nlifestyle just before the onset of PNES. On the other hand, in PNES with neither concomitant epilepsy nor mental\nretardation, we should seek advice from psychiatrists and clinical psychologists because the life history such as family\nrelationship is often critical in those patients.\nTypical seizure semiology suggesting PNES includes (1) long duration of seizure, (2) fluctuating symptoms during\nseizure, (3) asynchronous (left-right) body movements, (4) pelvic thrusting, (5) side-to-side swinging of the head and body,\n(6) closed eyes during seizure, (7) crying during seizure, (8) memory recall of seizure event, (9) no postictal confusion, and\n(10) seizures appear to occur during sleeping, but EEG findings show an arousal state2).\nHowever, no symptoms can lead to a definite diagnosis on their own, and the above symptoms should be considered as\nreference findings.\nIn the case of suspected PNES, we should confirm the diagnosis over time while following the clinical symptoms as well\nas performing environmental adjustment and psychotherapy.\nUrinary incontinence and tongue biting have been reported during seizures in patients with PNES, although the incidence\nis low3). Therefore, incontinence and tongue biting do not exclude a diagnosis of PNES4).\nAbnormally high prolactin concentration within 10‒20 minutes after the attack indicates the unlikeliness of PNES5).\nThere are four levels of certainty for a diagnosis of PNES, ranging from possible to documented. Table 1 shows the criteria\nfor the four levels5). Descriptions from a witness of seizure or a video of the actual seizure with routine EEG finding lead to\na “possible”, “probable” or “clinically established” diagnosis, while a “documented” diagnosis requires visit to a specialized\nhospital equipped with simultaneous ictal video-EEG recording.\nChapter 14 123\nThe main purpose of admission for making a definite diagnosis is to record ictal video-EEG. Moreover, the hospitalization\nalso provides medical staff a chance to observe the actual seizures.\nIn the case of dose reduction or cessation of antiepileptic drugs at the hospital, we should pay attention to the following\nrisks: manifestation of epileptic seizures that have been controlled until the reduction of drugs, withdrawal seizures in\npatients treated with phenobarbital and benzodiazepines for a certain period, and induction of status epilepticus.\n▪ References\n1) Kanemoto K, Fujiwara T, Ikeda A, et al.

Epilepsia. 2013; 54(11): 2005-2018.)\n124 Part I The Clinical Practice Guidelines for Epilepsy 2018\nCQ 14-2\nHow are psychogenic nonepileptic seizures treated?\nSummary\n(1) The management of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) includes: (1) clearly disclose the diagnosis to\nthe patient as a good news, without nuance of condemnation, (2) explain no need for antiepileptic drug, (3) list\nup the factors that induce seizure and the factors that perpetuate symptoms, (4) offer psychiatric evaluation, (5)\nimplement individual psychotherapy and family psychotherapy, and (6) consider the use of psychotropic drugs\nin patients with mood disorder, anxiety disorder, and somatization disorder.\n(2) In principle, antiepileptic drugs are tapered and stopped, but this involves risks such as transient deterioration\nof the psychological state or manifestation of epileptic seizures masked by antiepileptic drugs.\n(3) When associated with mental retardation (intellectual disability), disclose the diagnosis to the patient and the\nfamily, and at the same time adjust the social and psychological environments.\n(4) When PNES coexist with true epileptic seizures, explain in detail to the patients and their family which type\nof seizure is PNES and which type is epileptic seizure.\nComment\n(1) Even in patients with PNES confirmed by ictal video-EEG, all the seizures are not necessarily PNES. Considering this\npoint, we should initially explain it to the patients as follows, “Attacks due to emotional problems, not real epilepsy,\nmay coexist with attacks due to epilepsy”1).\nIn an RCT recruiting patients (IQ 70 or above) without coexisting epileptic seizures who had PNES attacks more\nthan twice a month, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for 4 months significantly reduced the seizure frequency\nwith a moderate or greater effect size, and the odds ratio of seizure control for at least 3 months was 3.1252).\nIn patients who have taken antiepileptic drugs for long periods of time, some feel that epilepsy is their major\nproblem in life because they believe “they cannot get a job due to epilepsy” and “they cannot have children because of\nepilepsy”. These patients may have severe psychological disturbance due to loss of identity. Negating the diagnosis of\nepilepsy needs to go hand in hand with formation of new identity.\nShowing the data of ictal video-EEG recorded during seizure to the patient and family is often educational and\neffective. However, care has to be taken not to convey a value judgment that PNES are false seizures. Most of the\nPNES are not malingering disorders, but are seizures caused by endogenous conflict.\nWhen referring a patient to a psychiatrist, the message to the patient and family has to be carefully worded so as\nnot to be perceived as sending them away from one’s care, such as, “To exclude all possible disorders and to try all\npossible treatments, let’s also ask the psychiatrist to give us some advice.” It is desirable to follow the patient by both\ndepartments for at least a certain period of time.\n(2) In principle, antiepileptic drugs are reduced in dose and stopped3). Particularly at the cessation of drugs, it is necessary\nto explain in advance to the patient and family about the possibility of emergence of epilepsy seizures controlled by\nmedications so far or appearance of withdrawal syndrome1).\nWhen the patient and family are very anxious about seizure relapse during dose reduction or cessation of antiepileptic\ndrugs, or when the family has difficulties in coping with urgent situations such as emergency hospital visit, then short-\nterm inpatient treatment is indicated.\nIf the patient and family request inpatient treatment because they worry about frequent seizures, explain to them\nthat he/she will be hospitalized as a part of psychotherapy in collaboration with the psychiatrist. We should try to\nprevent long-term hospitalization.\n(3) When the patient has coexisting mental retardation (intellectual disability), explain and disclose the diagnosis to the\npatient and family and at the same time adjust the psychological and social environments. Full-fledged psychotherapy\naccompanied by introspection is often difficult to conduct. Listen carefully to the situations leading to PNES, such as\nloss of parents who protected the patient, big changes in workplace, and human relation at work1).\nMaintain an environment that does not encourage gain from illness, such as getting help from many staff members\nwhen seizures occur or admission to a hospital when the patient shows PNES. We should adjust the environment so\nthat the patient can receive appropriate attention and protection even without showing PNES.\nChapter 14 125\nDisclosure of PNES coexisting with epileptic seizures is more easily accepted by the patient and family, because\nthe presence of PNES does not entail changes in the basic treatment framework such as transfer to another department\nand cessation of medications.\n(4) When PNES coexist with true epileptic seizures, explain in detail to the patient and family which type of seizure is\nPNES and which type is epileptic seizure. For the antiepileptic drugs, reduce the doses and change to monotherapy if\npossible.\n▪ References\n1) Kanemoto K, Fujiwara T, Ikeda A, et al.

In patients with a long\nduration of psychotic symptoms, taper gradually from 1‒2 months after complete remission.\n(4) For postictal psychosis, administer benzodiazepine or a sedating antipsychotic drug to induce sleep during the\nlucid interval after seizure clustering or during the manic state just before emergence of psychotic symptoms.\nComment\n(1) Psychosis (psychotic disorder or psychiatric symptoms) is a state of obviously abnormal behaviors such as delusions,\npronounced hallucinations with lack of insight, or disorganized languages, disorganized behavior, and catatonic\nbehavior. In a meta-analysis1), the frequency of psychosis associated with epilepsy was 5.6% (95% CI: 4.8‒6.4%, odds\nratio 7.8) among all patients with epilepsy, and 7% (95% CI: 4.9‒9.1%) among patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.\nThe frequency of interictal psychosis was 5.2% (95% CI: 3.3‒7.2%) and that of postictal psychosis was 2% (95% CI:\n1.2‒2.8%). Preictal psychosis and ictal psychosis are rare.\nInterictal psychosis2) is delusional psychosis with strong emotional change, sometimes accompanied by first-rank\nsymptoms typical of schizophrenia such as feeling of being manipulated, but unlike schizophrenia, emotions are\npreserved.\nAlternative psychosis2) is a subtype of interictal psychosis with various emotional symptoms and delusions occurring\nwhen seizures are controlled. The EEG often shows forced normalization (paradoxical normalization), but EEG\nexamination is not a requisite for the diagnosis. Alternative psychosis sometimes occurs when seizures disappear\nfollowing epilepsy surgery3).\nPostictal psychosis2) occurs after seizure clustering (rarely after a single seizure). After a lucid interval of 24 to 48\nhours, visual hallucination, auditory hallucination, or delusion occurs within one week. Various hallucination-delusion\nstates accompanied by emotional changes last from a few days to a few weeks (usually 1‒2 weeks).\n(2) For the treatment of psychosis, antipsychotic agents are used as for schizophrenia4). Many antiepileptic drugs induce\nhepatic metabolic enzymes and attenuate the effects of antipsychotic agents. Therefore, high-dose antipsychotics may\nbe needed5). If antiepileptic drugs are suspected to have induced psychotic symptoms, consider dose reduction and\ndiscontinuation of the antiepileptic drugs4, 5).\n(3) After remission of psychotic symptoms, reduce the doses of antipsychotic agents carefully. In patients with prolonged\npsychotic symptoms, reduce doses gradually from 1‒2 months after complete remission5).\n(4) During the lucid interval after seizure clustering or during the manic state, administration of benzodiazepine or a\nsedating antipsychotic drug to induce sleep may prevent the postictal psychosis or mitigate psychotic symptoms4).\nChapter 15 127\n▪ References\n1) Clancy MJ, Clarke MC, Connor DJ, et al.

After\nrecovery from the second or subsequent depression episode, continue antidepressant even after recovery.\n(4) For patients with a history of depression, when tapering antiepileptic drugs which also have mood-stabilizing\neffect, carefully taper those drugs.\n(5) Antiepileptic drugs may increase suicide-related behaviors. Provide information to patients and their families\nregarding the negative psychotropic effects of antiepileptic drugs. Consult with experts in mental health for\nhigh risk patients.\nComment\n(1) In a meta-analysis of epilepsy and depression1), the overall prevalence of active (current or in the past year) depression\nwas 23.1% (95% CI: 20.6‒28.3%), with an odds ratio of 2.77 (95% CI: 2.09‒3.67). The lifetime prevalence was\n13.0% (95% CI: 5.1‒33.1%) with an odds ratio of 2.20 (95% CI: 1.07–4.51).\nTreatments include individualized supportive psychotherapy, psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral therapy\n(CBT), and antidepressants2). According to systematic reviews3, 4), antidepressants and CBT are effective. Especially,\nCBT tailored to individual patient is useful.\n(2) The first-line antidepressants are new antidepressant that are less likely to exacerbate seizures, such as a selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin‒noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Start with a low dose to\nreduce adverse effects and increase until the therapeutic effect appears.\nAmong SSRIs, enzyme inhibitors such as fluvoxamine may increase serum concentrations of antiepileptic drugs.\nWhen lithium carbonate is used in combination with antiepileptic drugs, adverse effects such as seizure exacerbation\nand neurotoxicity may occur. Pay special attention to encephalopathy when combined with carbamazepine.\n(3) For the first depression episode, continue antidepressants for around 6 months even after recovery. From the second\nor subsequent depression episode, continue antidepressants for around 2 years after recovery.\n(4) In patients with a history of mood disorder, carefully taper antiepileptic drugs with mood-stabilizing effect\n(carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproate, and lamotrigine) when tapering those drugs.\n(5) Provide information to patients and families regarding the negative psychotropic effect of antiepileptic drugs.\nEspecially, pay attention to suicidal ideation in patients with a history of mental disorders.\nIn patients with a history of suicidal ideation, avoid antiepileptic drugs that induce depression. In patients with a\nhistory of episodic behavioral disorders, pay attention to the manifestation of depression in association with a seizure-\nfree state, and consult a mental health expert for patients at high risk of these symptoms2).\nA systematic review reported no sufficient evidence for a significant association between antiepileptic drugs and\nsuicide-related behaviors5). However, expert consensus from the ILEA Task Force on Therapeutic Strategies proposed\nthe followings.6) (1) Although some antiepileptic drugs may induce psychiatric symptoms and lead to suicidal tendency,\nits rate is very low and the actual suicidal risk is yet to be established. (2) Suicide in epilepsy is multifactorial. Even in\npatients with some suicide risk factors, treatment should not be withdrawn. (3) When starting or switching antiepileptic\ndrugs, we (attending doctors) should tell patients to report any mode changes and suicidal ideation when they appear.\n(4). In clinical trials, information on psychiatric adverse effects caused by antiepileptic drugs should be collected,\nincluding family and past history of psychiatric disorders, past history of suicidal behaviors, and screening result using\na suicide scale.\nChapter 15 129\n▪ References\n1) Fiest KM, Dykeman J, Patten SB, et al.

This definition\nwas also adopted by Beghi et al.2).\nAmong acute symptomatic seizures, convulsive seizures mostly occur only once, but may be repeated or even develop to\nstatus epilepticus. Convulsive seizures may recur when the above disorders relapse.\nAcute symptomatic seizure is clearly distinguished from epileptic seizure unprovoked by organic disorders (see CQ 1-1 on\npage 2).\n▪ References\n1) Guidelines for epidemiologic studies on epilepsy.

Perform a\nsystemic search for the presence of neoplastic disorders including ovarian teratoma.\n(2) After starting appropriate circulatory and respiratory management, consider surgical resection of the tumor\nin the early stage if paraneoplastic syndrome is suspected. Also consider steroid pulse therapy, high-dose\nintravenous immunoglobulin therapy, plasmapheresis, and immunosuppressants (currently not covered by\nmedical insurance).\nComment\nAnti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is more prevalent in young women. It initially manifests\ndiverse psychiatric symptoms such as emotional disorder, memory impairment, hallucination, and delusion; and later shows\nconvulsive seizures and involuntary movements such as dyskinesia, respiratory failure, and autonomic nervous system\nsymptoms1, 2). Convulsive seizures may be the initial symptom3).\nBrain MRI shows high signal intensity regions in mesial temporal lobe, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum on T2-weighted\nimages. Cells and proteins increase in cerebrospinal fluid. However, these abnormal findings are absent in some cases1, 2).\nMeasurement of autoantibodies including anti-NMDA receptor antibody in blood and cerebrospinal fluid specimens is\nrequisite for the diagnosis1, 2). However, these tests can be done only in a limited number of facilities. Systemic search for\nmalignancies is recommended because tumors such as ovarian teratoma may be involved in the pathophysiology1, 2, 4).\nWe should consider early surgical resection of a tumor when its involvement is suspected1, 2). When acute anti-NMDA\nreceptor antibody encephalitis is strongly suspected, consider steroid pulse therapy, high-dose immunoglobulin therapy,\nplasmapheresis, and immunosuppressants1, 3, 4). There is no high level evidence for the choice of treatment method.\n▪ References\n1) Dalmau J, Gleichman AJ, Hughes EG, et al.

However, the frequency varies depending on the cause of epilepsy.\nThere is no clear pattern of inheritance for epilepsy in general.\nComment\nThe genetic factor plays a small role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy in general1). Therefore, we should take care not to give\nexcessive anxiety to patients and their families and not to lead them to misunderstand the negative impact of the genetic\nfactor.\nIn some patients, family history reveals definite inheritance patterns (epilepsy syndrome) such as autosomal dominant and\nrecessive inheritance, or sex-linked inheritance. However, the inheritance pattern is undetermined in most of the patients\nwith epilepsy. The familial prevalence and the rate of EEG abnormalities differ even for the same epilepsy syndrome,\nsuggesting multifactorial inheritance pattern involving many overlapping factors. The incidence rate of epilepsy in\ndescendants of the patients is 6%, which is clearly higher than the incidence for people aged up to 20 years in the general\npopulation (1‒2%). When the mother has epilepsy or when one of the parents has absence seizures, the incidence rate is\nfurther increased to 8–9%2). In addition, epilepsy occurs relatively frequently in siblings of patients with epilepsy. In the case\nthat the onset age of the proband is under 15 years, the incidence rate of epilepsy in siblings by 20 years of age is 3‒5%2).\nMoreover, the incidence rate increases to 5‒15% in the proband’s siblings when the EEG of the proband shows generalized\nspike-and-wave complex, or when the proband’s parent is (or both parents are) affected by epilepsy2).\nRegarding febrile convulsion, while the prevalence in children is 7‒11% (4% in other countries), the prevalence increases\nto 20‒25% in siblings of patients with febrile convulsion. Also, children with febrile convulsion will eventually have non-\nfebrile convulsion (epilepsy) at a higher rate when their parents are affected by epilepsy3, 4).\n▪ References\n1) Genetics Commission of International League Against Epilepsy.

However, genetic diagnosis has clinical\nsignificance in only a few epilepsy syndromes. Identification of gene abnormalities leads to a definite diagnosis only\nfor progressive myoclonic epilepsy, Angelman syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Dravet syndrome.\nComment\nThe causative genetic abnormalities for various epilepsy syndromes are shown in Table 11, 2), and those for progressive\nmyoclonic epilepsy (PME) are shown in Table 23). When Dravet syndrome is suspected, gene testing is useful because the\nfindings from the SCN1A genetic test may help us determine the treatment strategy and provide genetic counseling at an\nearlier stage than when diagnosis is obtained from only clinical symptoms4).\nOn the other hand, based on the current knowledge about genetic research on epilepsy, genetic results cannot accurately\npredict the prognosis (for example, patients with the same SCN1A mutation may have different phenotypes). Moreover, even\nwhen the genetic test result is negative, it does not exclude the possibility of having an unknown causative gene or a gene\nunidentifiable by conventional sequence analyses such as copy-number polymorphisms. It should be noted that genetic tests\nhave only limited usefulness for exclusion diagnosis.\nFurthermore, many genetic tests are not covered by medical insurance at present, making it difficult to be used as a routine\ntest in the clinical practice.\n▪ References\n1) Ottman R, Hirose S, Jain S, et al.

The required criterion\nis that seizure that impairs consciousness or movement during the awake state has not occurred for a period of 2 years\n(operation standards for issuing license by the Public Safety Commission, Table 1).\n(3) A patient should declare the disease condition accurately when obtaining or renewing the driver’s license (partially\nrevised law of Road Traffic Act, with penalty).\n(4) If the driver’s license was revoked due to illness but later the patient recovers to a state capable of re-acquiring the\nlicense, the written test and the practical test will be exempted (partially revised law of Road Traffic Act).\n(5) For epilepsy with a risk of recurrence of seizures that impair consciousness or movement, if a patient, despite being\nunder influence of the above condition (with a risk of hindering normal driving) and consequently not able to drive\nnormally, drives a motor vehicle and causes death or injury, a penalty will be imposed which is heavier than that for\nprofessional negligence resulting in death (Act on Punishment of Acts Inflicting Death or Injury on Others by Driving\na Motor Vehicle).\nIn giving advice on whether or not to drive a car, in principle provide guidance in accordance with domestic laws (Table 1).\nFor items without legal provisions, provide appropriate medical guidance, such as the following.\n(1) “There is no risk of seizure” in the Act is usually interpreted as “the risk is considerably low” rather than “the risk of\nseizure is zero”.\n(2) Even after seizures has not occurred for 2 years, instruct the patient not to drive during periods when the risk of seizure\nrelapse is judged medically to be high, such as after changing antiepileptic drugs, under poor physical condition, or\nlack of sleep.\n(3) When epilepsy is newly diagnosed or when seizure relapses after a certain seizure-free period, even if the patient still\nretains the driver’s license, he/she is in “a state of not able to drive normally”. Therefore, advise the patient not to drive\nfor 2 years.\n(4) At the first attack which is not diagnosed as epilepsy, instruct the patient not to drive for a certain period (for example,\n6 months).\nFor reference\nAccording to the revised Road Traffic Law and operation standards enforced on June 1, 2014, a driver’s license is permitted\nif a patient with epilepsy meets the prescribed conditions. Whether a license is issued is determined by the Public Safety\nCommission based on a doctor’s medical report or a special fitness screening. Regarding epilepsy and driver’s license, there\nis a detailed comment in the Q&A regarding the revised Road Traffic Act on the website of the Japan Epilepsy Society1).\nIf there is any question, contact the “Inquiry Desk for Fitness of Driving” installed in prefectural driver’s license centers, or\nChapter 18 143\nrecommend patients to consult the driver’s license center.\nFrom 2014, when a patient is diagnosed to be in a state subject to denial of driver’s license provided by the Operation\nStandards of the Road Traffic Act, and the patient is found to possess a driver’s license and is actually driving, it is possible\nto report the case to the Public Safety Commission on a voluntary basis.

However, when submitting a notification, pay close attention to avoid damaging the\ndoctor-patient relationship, with the result that the patient avoids reporting his/her medical condition accurately or receiving\nproper medical care.\n(4) Refer to the guidelines of the Japan Medical Association for specific notification procedures to the Public Safety Committee.\nChapter 18 145\nPart II\nSystematic Review Digest\nCQ 9-2 Digest Edition\nCQ 9-2\nShould temporal lobe resection be added to drug therapy in\ndrug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy?\nRecommendation\nWe recommend temporal lobectomy in addition to drug therapies in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (GRADE\n2D) (weak recommendation, very low level of evidence).\n• Supplementary note: In the GRADE system, when the evidence level is “very low”, in principle it is not possible\nto grade “strong recommendation”. Since temporal lobe resection is highly effective with low incidence of adverse\neffects, almost all the panelists supported “strong recommendation”, but due to the constraint of the GRADE\nsystem, the final grading was “weak recommendation”.\n1. Background, priority of the problem\nFor drug-resistant epilepsy, adding further new drugs has limited effect. The temporal lobe resection is expected to achieve\nseizure-free condition despite its invasiveness.\n2. Comment\nEvidence summary\nThere were 2 randomized controlled trials (RCT) (total 118 patients) on the effectiveness of temporal lobe resection for\ndrug-resistant epilepsy1, 2). With regard seizure outcome, the relative risk was 20.57 (95% confidence interval 4.24‒99.85)\nand the number needed to treat (NNT: indicating the number of persons needed to treat to achieve the outcome for one\nperson) was 4, showing superiority of temporal lobe resection. Neither of the two RCTs mentioned decrease of antiepileptic\ndrugs after surgery. Death rate did not differ between two groups.\nThe relative risk of surgical complications was 12.33 (95% confidence interval 1.67‒90.89), and was higher in the temporal\nlobe resection group. Death, memory impairment, and psychiatric symptoms were not significantly different between the\ntwo groups. Quality of life (QOL) improvement was superior in the temporal lobe resection group.\n3. Panel meeting\n3-1. What is the overall quality of evidence across outcomes?\nSince we were not able to mask the intervention, the risk of bias was high overall in the collected studies. Bias for death\nwas considered not serious, while that for the other outcomes was considered serious and was downgraded one rank.\nInconsistency and non-directness of the results were without question and considered not serious. For imprecision, confidence\nintervals crossed the clinical decision threshold in many items, and was downgraded one or two ranks. Publication bias\ncould not be judged because of the small number of studies. Consequently, the level of evidence for the outcomes was as\nfollows: “low” for seizure freedom, death, surgical complications, and quality of life improvement; and “very low” for memory\nimpairment and psychiatric symptoms. The overall level of evidence was “D (very low)”.\n* For surgical therapy, since blinding of the control group is difficult, the level of evidence is generally low.\n3-2. How is the balance between benefits and harms?\nTemporal lobe resection can be expected to control seizures. As a result, antiepileptic drugs are possibly reduced although\nit is not shown in RCT. The incidence of serious adverse effects was low. Therefore, the risk of temporal lobe resection is\nconsidered to be smaller compared to its benefit.\n148 Part II Systematic Review Digest\n3-3. What about patients’ values and preference?\nSome patients may feel resistant to receive invasive surgical therapy, but the beneficial effect of seizure-free produced by\nthe surgery outweighs the resistance to the invasive procedure. There is perhaps no significant uncertainty or variability in\nvalue among the patients.\n3-4. What is the balance between net benefit and cost or resources?\nThe health insurance fee scale for epilepsy surgery using a microscope (including temporal lobe resection) is 131,630\npoints (as of January 11, 2018). The surgery is conducted under general anesthesia and requires neurosurgeons.\nHowever, through reducing antiepileptic drugs, decreasing hospitalization duration accompanying reduced seizures, and\nenabling more active social activities, epilepsy surgery is expected to lead to saving in the long term. For this reason, the cost\ncan be considered negligible.\n3-5. Recommendation grading\nDuring the discussions at the panel meeting, temporal lobe resection was expected to eliminate seizures, and overall the\ncost of the surgery could be considered negligible. Even taking the adverse effects into account, the surgery was supported\nby panelists.\nAt the panel meeting, many panelists supported a recommendation grade of “strong recommendation”. However, in the\nGRADE system, when the evidence level is “very low”, in general we are not able to grade “strong recommendation”. For this\nreason, the final grading was “weak recommendation”.\n4. Descriptions in other related guidelines\nIn Japan, the Japan Epilepsy Society published the “Guideline on indications for epilepsy surgery”3) in 2008, and\n“Guideline on diagnosis and surgical indications of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy”4) in 2010.\nThe “Guideline on indications for epilepsy surgery” recommends surgical treatment for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy at a\nsuitable timing, stating that “since surgical results are superior in cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with a localized\norganic lesion or with extensive lesions in unilateral hemisphere, consider surgical treatment from an early stage and do not\nmiss the timing of surgery”. The “Guideline on diagnosis and surgical indications of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy” also\nfollows the above recommendation, stating that “patients should be selected in accordance with the guideline on indications\nfor epilepsy surgery”.\nIn overseas countries, the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, the American\nEpilepsy Society, and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons published a guideline5) in 2003. The guideline\nstates that “drug-resistant epilepsy should be considered for referral to an epilepsy surgery center” and that “patients who\nmeet established criteria for an anteromesial temporal lobe resection and who accept the risks and benefits of this procedure\nshould be offered surgical treatment”.\n5. Treatment monitoring and evaluation\nMonitoring and evaluation during the perioperative period of treatment are generally performed by a neurosurgeon. After\nthis period, although a neurosurgeon is not necessarily required to monitor and evaluate, follow-up and support should be\nprovided to the patients.\n6. Possibility of future research\nSome memory-preserving or minimally invasive surgery may be developed in the future. In addition, we would like to\nknow the surgical outcomes and adverse events over a longer follow-up period because the observation periods of the two\nRCT were 1 year1) and 2 years2).\n7.

Relative risk of freedom from seizure due to\ntemporal lobe resection was 20.57 (95% confidence interval 4.24‒99.85) and NNT was 4. No studies investigating the\noutcome of antiepileptic drug reduction was found. There was no significant increase in death due to surgery.\nComplications related to surgery were increased with relative risk of 12.33 (95% confidence interval 1.67‒90.89), and\nincluded stroke and infection. Other than these, Wiebe et al, reported transient visual defect in approximately one-half\nof patients in surgery group. Memory impairment tended to increase when temporal lobe resection was added to drug\ntherapy, but there was no significant difference. The main psychiatric symptom was depression, but there was no\nsignificant difference between with and without temporal lobe resection. Quality of life (QOL) was superior in the group\nwith add-on temporal lobe resection.\nCertainty of evidence: Since masking of the intervention was impossible, the risk of bias in the studies collected was high\noverall. Bias for death was considered not serious, while that for other outcomes was considered serious and downgraded\none rank. Inconsistency and non-directness of the results were without question, and not serious. For imprecision,\nconfidence intervals crossed the clinical decision threshold in many cases, and was downgraded one or two ranks.\nPublication bias could not be judged because of the small number of studies. Consequently, the certainty of evidence for\nthe outcomes was as follows: “low” for seizure freedom, death, surgical complications, and QOL improvement; and “very\nlow” for memory impairment and psychiatric symptoms. The overall certainty of evidence was “D (very low)”.\nJudgment of benefits and harms, burden, and cost:\nSurgical invasiveness is high. However, the merit of freedom from seizure in patients with drug resistant epilepsy is great,\nand the efficacy is also high.\nRecommendation:\nAddition of temporal lobe resection to drug therapy is proposed for drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy.\n(strength of recommendation “weak recommendation” / certainty of evidence “very low”)\nAdditional considerations:\nAccording to GRADE, when the certainty of evidence is “very low”, in principle it is not possible to rank “strong\nrecommendation”. Since temporal lobe resection is expected to be highly effective with low incidence of adverse effects,\nthe opinion of almost all of the panelists was “strong recommendation” at the panel meeting, but due to the constraint of\nthe GRADE system, the final grade was “weak recommendation”.\nSubgroup No RCTs comparing surgical methods were identified.\nconsiderations.\nConsider how to set\ncriteria for patient\npopulation or intervention,\nwhich may change the\nrecommendation statement\nImplementation Selection of the optimal surgical method depending on the cause is necessary.\nconsiderations. Follow-up and support after surgery are necessary.\nIn clinical practice,\nproblems such as feasibility\nand tolerability may arise.\nMonitoring and\nevaluation.\nWhat kind of monitoring\nis necessary during\nimplementation? Is\nevaluation necessary\nbefore or after publication?\nResearch possibilities. There is room for further research on the development of memory-preserving, minimally invasive surgery. In addition,\nWhat are the unclear the observation periods of the two RCT were 1 year and 2 years, and there is accumulating interest on the data of surgical\npoints in judgment that outcomes and adverse events over a longer period of follow-up.\nrequire future research?\nCQ 9-2 Digest Edition 161\nCQ 10-1 Digest Edition\nCQ 10-1\nShould vagus nerve stimulation therapy be added to drug\ntherapies for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy?\nRecommendation\nWe suggest to add vagus nerve stimulation to drug therapies (GRADE 2D) (weak recommendation, very low level\nof evidence).\n• Supplementary note: In principle, vagus nerve stimulation is considered for patients with no indication for\ncurative surgery. Implantation of the vagus nerve stimulation device involves surgery under general anesthesia\nin an experienced hospital. After implantation, the patients need to be followed in the hospital where operation\nwas performed or other facilities, by experts with experience in stimulator control.\n1. Background, priority of the problem\nIn patients with drug-resistant epilepsy in whom seizures are not controlled even after trials of two appropriate antiepileptic\ndrugs, further addition of drugs has only limited effect. Vagus nerve stimulation added to antiepileptic drug therapy is\nexpected to provide additive effect of seizure frequency reduction. Because vagus nerve stimulation is less invasive and has\nlower seizure control effect compared to brain surgery with craniotomy, it may be selected as a treatment option in patients\nwith no indication for curative neurosurgery.\n2. Comment\nEvidence summary\nOnly one randomized controlled trial (RCT) examined the effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation for drug-resistant\nepilepsy1). We therefore considered to use observational studies together. However, because outcomes of those studies, such\nas reduced seizure frequency and mood change, are susceptible to placebo effect, we determined to use a single RCT.\nRegarding efficacy, the relative risk for 50% seizure frequency reduction was 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.59‒3.04),\nand NNT (number needed to treat: indicating the number of persons needed to treat to achieve the outcome for one person)\nwas 25. As for mood changes, there were no significant differences between the intervention group and control group in the\nscores for several scales: QOLIE-89 (89-item Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory), CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic\nstudies Depression scale), and NDDI-E (Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory in Epilepsy scale). Regarding mood\nchanges, the only scale showing a statistically significant difference was the 7-point evaluation scale CGI-I (Clinical Global\nImpression of Impression Important Scale), but the difference was only 0.5 (95% confidence interval 0.99‒0.01), showing a\nsmall effect. For serious adverse events, vocal cord paralysis and brief respiratory arrest occurred only in the intervention\ngroup, but were transient with no sequelae. There was no significant difference in the adverse event of dysphonia between the\nintervention group and the control group.\nIt should be noted that the selected RCT was prematurely terminated by the sponsor due to a low recruitment rate,\nbecause many study candidates did not accept randomization of the treatment. Therefore, the study may be underpowered\nfor detection of the outcome.\n162 Part II Systematic Review Digest\n3. Panel meeting\n3-1. What is the overall quality of evidence across outcomes?\nIn the study reviewed, the risk of bias was high overall, which was judged as serious for all the outcomes, and was\ndowngraded by one rank. The inconsistency of results was not downgraded because of only one study used. The indirectness\nwas judged as not serious and without any problems. As for imprecision, the confidence intervals in many analyses crossed\nthe clinical decision threshold, and it was hence downgraded by one or two ranks. As for publishing bias, there was only one\nstudy, and therefore was not downgraded. Consequently, the level of evidence for the outcomes was as follows: “very low”\nfor seizure frequency ≤ 50%, serious adverse events, and dysphonia; and “low” for the other outcomes. The overall level of\nevidence was “very low”.\n3-2. What is the balance between benefits and harms?\nSince there was only one RCT, the certainty of the effect estimate was low, and it was difficult to consider the balance\nbetween benefits and harms.\n3-3. What about patients’ values and preferences?\nThe importance of outcomes has great inter-individual differences, and it should be diverse, It should be noted that some\npatients place importance on the reduction of seizure frequency, while others regard the risk of adverse effects to be more\nimportant.\n3-4. What is the balance between net benefit and cost or resources?\nThe electrode implantation for VNS surgery is conducted under general anesthesia. Vagus nerve stimulation is covered\nby health insurance, and the health insurance fee scale for implantation is 24,350 points, and that for exchange is 4,800\npoints (as of January 11, 2018). The reoperation should be done once every few years for replacement of the power generator\nbecause of degradation of the condenser. Considering the effectiveness for refractory epilepsy and the above-mentioned\nfactors, the cost was judged to be moderate.\n3-5. Recommendation grading\nDuring the discussions at the panel meeting, considering the moderate burden and cost, and the few alternative treatment\noptions available, the panelists concluded that it was reasonable to use this treatment method despite a certain amount of\nharm, burden and cost. The unanimous decision was “to propose implementing vagus nerve stimulation for drug-resistant\nepilepsy”. As an additional consideration, the patients’ families at the panel meeting expressed the following opinion: “We\ndesire to overcome social constraints. If there is any method at all, please include it as one of the options.”\n4. Descriptions in other related guidelines\nIn Japan, the “Practice guideline of vagus nerve stimulation therapy for epilepsy”2) was published by the Japan Epilepsy\nSociety in 2012, which states that “VNS has accommodative effect on drug-resistant epileptic seizures [recommendation\ngrade A]”. Also, the American Academy of Neurology released a guideline update entitled “Vagus nerve stimulation for the\ntreatment of epilepsy” in 2013. This guideline update describes the possibilities of the effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation\nappearing several years after VNS operation, the effectiveness in children [rate of > 50% seizure reduction: 55% (95%\nconfidence interval 50‒59%)], and an increased risk of infection in children compared to adults [odds ratio 3.4 (95%\nconfidence interval 1.0‒11.2)].\nAccording to the guidelines in Japan and overseas and the recommendation from the ILEA, the indication for vagus nerve\nstimulation is in principle patients who have no indication for curative neurosurgery2-4).\n5. Treatment monitoring and evaluation\nVagus nerve stimulation treatment requires adjustment of the stimulation conditions, management of complications, and\nsolving equipment troubles. Epilepsy specialists or doctors trained by the specialists should perform monitoring and\nevaluation after the operation based on specialist knowledge.\n6. Possibility of future research\nThe RCT reviewed for this CQ had high risk of bias. Therefore, it is desirable to have more RCTS with better quality. In\naddition, research focusing on how to identify good responders and the effects on status epilepticus is needed in the future.\nCQ 10-1 Digest Edition 163\n7.

For inconsistency of results, there was only one study, and therefore was not downgraded.\nThere was no problem with indirectness and was judged not serious. As for imprecision, the confidence intervals in many\nanalyses crossed the clinical decision threshold; hence was downgraded by one or two ranks. As for publishing bias, there\nwas only one study, and therefore was not downgraded. Consequently, the certainty of evidence for the outcomes was as\nfollows: “very low” for seizure frequency ≤ 50%, serious adverse events, and dysphonia; and “low” for the other outcomes.\nThe overall certainty of evidence was “very low”.\nJudgment of benefits and harms, burden and cost:\nSince there was only 1 RCT, the certainty of effect estimate was low, and it was difficult to judge the balance between\nbenefits and harms. Among the serious adverse events, vocal cord paralysis and brief respiratory arrest that occurred only\nin the intervention group were transient with no sequelae. Burden and cost are moderate.

Background, priority of this issue\nThe efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation is known to depend on the stimulation conditions. The intensity of stimulation\nshould be adjusted while monitoring its therapeutic effect and adverse effects. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether\nhigh intensity stimulation or low intensity stimulation is superior when conducting VNS.\nIn addition, as mentioned in CQ 10-1 “Should vagus nerve stimulation therapy be added to drug therapies for drug-\nresistant temporal lobe epilepsy?”, we have difficulty in performing comparison between real VNS and sham VNS (with no\nstimulation). Therefore, there is an increase in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using low intensity stimulation as sham\nstimulation (placebo stimulation or pseudo-stimulation) to compare with high intensity stimulation.\nThere is one Cochrane Review1) on a similar clinical question. This review shows that high intensity stimulation has\nsuperior therapeutic effect, while treatment withdrawal is rare both when using high and low intensity stimulation.\n2. Comment\nEvidence summary\nThere were 4 RCTs that examined the efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy2‒5).\nFor efficacy, the relative risk of seizure frequency ≤ 50% was 1.74 (95% confidence interval 1.14‒2.65) and NNT (number\nneeded to treat: indicating the number of persons needed to treat to achieve the outcome for one person) was 10. For adverse\nevents, low level stimulation was significantly superior in dysphonia and hoarseness (relative risk 2.06, 95% confidence\ninterval 1.34‒3.17) and dyspnea (relative risk 2.43, 95% confidence interval 1.29‒4.57). Treatment withdrawal, cough, and\npain did not differ significantly between high level and low level stimulations.\n3. Panel meeting\n3-1. What is the quality of evidence about the overall outcomes?\nIn all the studies collected, the risk of bias was low overall, and the level was not downgraded for all the outcomes. For\ninconsistency of the results, I was 32% for only dysphonia / hoarseness. Since the effect estimate differed between studies,\n2\nheterogeneity was considered high. Inconsistency was thus considered serious and was downgraded one rank. There was no\nproblem with indirectness, and was judged not serious. As for imprecision, the confidence intervals in many analyses crossed\nthe clinical decision thresholds, and hence was downgraded by one or two ranks. Regarding publication bias, there were only\nfour studies, and therefore was not downgraded. Consequently, the level of evidence for the outcomes was as follows:\n“moderate” for seizure frequency ≤ 50%, cough, and dyspnea; “low” for treatment withdrawal, dysphonia/ hoarseness, and\npain. The overall level of evidence was “low”.\n178 Part II Systematic Review Digest\n3-2. What is the balance between benefits and harms?\nHigh level stimulation was superior to low level stimulation for the outcome of seizure frequency ≤ 50%. Among the\nadverse events, dysphonia/hoarseness and dyspnea showed lower rates in low level stimulation, but since there was no\nsignificant difference in treatment withdrawal between two groups, there must be few adverse events serious enough to cause\ntreatment withdrawal. According to expert opinion, many adverse events are reversible and can be controlled by adjusting\nthe stimulation current intensity. Taken together, we decided that high level stimulation is probably superior in terms of the\nbalance between benefits and harms.\n3-3. What about patients’ values and preferences?\nWe concluded that there is probably no significant uncertainty and variability in patient’s values and preferences because\nhigh level stimulation is more effective than low level stimulation, and although adverse events are more prevalent in high\nlevel stimulation, they are reversible and can be controlled by adjusting the stimulation current.\n3-4. What is the balance between net benefit and cost or resources?\nAdjustment of stimulation intensity can be done by placing the programming wand over the subcutaneously implanted\ngenerator; thus resources and costs are negligible. However, reoperation is needed to replace the generator every few years\nwhen the battery runs out. Battery consumption is higher for high level stimulation than for low level stimulation. Based on\nthese, it was decided that high level stimulation costs moderately more as compared to low level stimulation.\n3-5. Recommendation grading\nIn the discussions at the panel meeting, high level stimulation was considered superior in efficacy, and adverse effects were\nacceptable because most of them were presumably at a level that would not cause treatment withdrawal. As for burden and\ncost, high level stimulation was expected to consume more battery power, requiring more frequent generator exchange.\nBased on the above arguments, despite considerable adverse events that did not cause treatment withdrawal as well as the\nincreased burden and cost, we finally unanimously recommended using high level stimulation, considering the highly\nanticipated seizure control effect.\n4. Descriptions in other related guidelines\nIn Japan, the “Guideline on implementation of vagus nerve stimulation therapy for epilepsy”6) was published by the Japan\nEpilepsy Society in 2012, which states that “In principle, initiate VNS two weeks after implantation. Start with low stimulation\nintensity and then gradually increase the intensity while monitoring the adverse effects [recommendation grade C]”.\nIn 2013, the American Academy of Neurology released a guideline update entitled “Vagus nerve stimulation for the\ntreatment of epilepsy”. There is no recommendation for high level or low level stimulation in that guideline. However, it\nstates that whether stimulation at a higher frequency is more likely to reduce seizures than usual stimulation remains\nunknown.\n5. Treatment monitoring and evaluation\nFor adjusting stimulation intensity, we need a system which is capable of managing complications and coping with\nequipment troubles.\n6. Future research issues\nFurther research on the optimal intensity of stimulation is needed. In addition, other than stimulus intensity, there is no\nRCT on supplementary techniques such as magnet stimulation, which will be a future research subject. It is also desirable to\nelucidate the mechanisms underlying the subgroup with high response and develop evaluation methods to identify these\nsubjects.\n7.

For seizure frequency ≤50%, high level\nstimulation was significantly superior (relative risk 1.74, 1.14‒2.65) [NNT 10]. Among adverse events, significant\ndifferences were observed for dysphonia/ hoarseness (relative risk 2.06, 1.34‒3.17) and dyspnea (relative risk 2.43,\n1.29‒4.57). The relative risk of treatment withdrawal was 2.51 (0.50‒12.61), with no significant difference between high\nlevel stimulation and low level stimulation groups.\nCertainty of evidence: In all the studies collected, the risk of bias was low overall, and was not downgraded for all the\noutcomes. For inconsistency of the results, I was 32% for only dysphonia and hoarseness. Since the effect estimate\n2\ndiffered between studies, heterogeneity was considered high. Inconsistency was thus considered serious and was\ndowngraded one rank. There was no problem with indirectness, which was not serious. As for imprecision, the confidence\nintervals in many analyses crossed the clinical decision thresholds, and hence was downgraded by one or two ranks.\nRegarding publication bias, there were only four studies, and therefore was not downgraded. Consequently, the certainty\nof evidence for the outcomes was as follows: “moderate” for seizure frequency ≤50% cough, and dyspnea; and “low” for\ntreatment withdrawal, dysphonia/ hoarseness, and pain. The overall certainty of evidence was “low”.\nJudgment of benefits and harms, burden and cost:\nIn 4 RCTs, high level stimulation was significantly superior for the outcome of seizure frequency ≤50% outcome. Among\nthe adverse events, dysphonia/ hoarseness (relative risk 2.06, 1.34‒3.17) and dyspnea (relative risk 2.43, 1.29‒ 4.57) were\nsignificantly more frequent in high level stimulation, but both were transient. There was no significant difference in\ntreatment withdrawal between two groups (relative risk 2.51, 0.50‒12.61). As for the burden and cost, it is expected that\nhigh level stimulation consumes more battery power and requires a higher frequency of generator exchange. Taking the\nabove into consideration, despite adverse events that do not lead to treatment withdrawal and the possibility of increases\nin burden and cost, it is worth trying high level stimulation in anticipation of seizure control.\nRecommendation:\nWhen conducting vagus nerve stimulation for drug resistant epilepsy, high level stimulation rather than low level\nstimulation is recommended (strength of recommendation “strong recommendation”/certainty of evidence “low”).\nAdditional considerations:\nDue to the problems with research execution, it is difficult to realize comparative study of vagus nerve stimulation versus\nno stimulation. Therefore, there is an increase in RCT comparing high level stimulation versus low level stimulation.\nLow level stimulation is generally treated as sham stimulation (placebo group). On the other hand, theoretically there\nexists an argument: the fact that low level stimulation is harmful may account for the therapeutic effect observed when\ncompared with high level stimulation.\nSubgroup considerations.

The risk was even higher for people with sepsis, who are 4.5 times\nmore likely to have a second seizure than people who do not have sepsis. The committee\nagreed that these are significant risk factors that could be modified to try to prevent\nsecond seizures. Evidence for vascular risk factors did not show a difference in risk.\nHowever, based on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that conditions\nsuch as diabetes, hypertension and atrial fibrillation are important risk factors for seizures\nin adults that may also be modified.\nIn children, the committee acknowledged that there was a lack of clarity in the evidence\nfor risk associated with higher or lower temperature. A seizure because of a high\ntemperature does not necessarily predispose a child to more seizures, but they agreed\nthat increased temperature is important to take into consideration. Febrile seizures tend\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 93 of\nconditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nnot to predispose to a second afebrile seizure. However, afebrile seizures may be\nassociated with an increased risk of a second seizure. The committee agreed that parents\nand carers should be given information about the potential risk and how to self-refer\nshould the child have a second seizure. Safety guidance should also be given so that\nparents and carers can take precautions to minimise the risk of injury.\nThe risk factors identified in the studies are not the only factors that affect a person's\nchances of having a second seizure. For this reason, the committee decided that\nassessment should include identifying any potential mental, physical and social risk\nfactors, which should then be discussed with the person and their family or carers.\nThe committee discussed the evidence for prediction tools for a second seizure, but did\nnot recommend using any of these tools because they were considered to carry the\npotential for harm. The evidence suggested that the tools had a poor capacity to\ndiscriminate between people at low and high risk of second seizure. Therefore, the\ncommittee made a recommendation for research on developing and testing a risk\nprediction tool for second seizure.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThese recommendations are likely to mean a change in clinical practice for how adults are\ncared for after a first seizure. In current practice, only about 25% of adults are fully\nassessed for modifiable risk factors. Assessment includes checking for underlying mental\nhealth problems, vascular risk factors and sepsis. Although the recommendations for\nadults will result in a change in clinical practice, the assessment does not take long and is\nnot expected to result in a substantial resource impact. A small increase in costs is likely\nfor additional staff time to assess people presenting with a first seizure.\nThe recommendation made for children reflects current practice so the committee agreed\nthere should be no substantial resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\nSpecialist assessment and diagnosis\nRecommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.10\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 94 of\nconditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nIn assessing the evidence for individual tests to diagnose epilepsy, the committee agreed\nthat a diagnostic test would need to give the lowest possible level of false-positive and\nfalse-negative results. False-positive results may result in unnecessary treatment and\nanxiety, whereas false-negative results may result in people with epilepsy remaining\nundiagnosed and untreated. Given the seriousness of these harms, the committee agreed\nthat a 10% rate for false negatives and a 10% rate for false positives were the highest\nacceptable rates (equating to a minimally acceptable value of 0.9 for both sensitivity and\nspecificity). Most tests evaluated in the review did not meet this threshold.\nClinical history and examination provided by a specialist in epilepsy demonstrated levels of\nsensitivity and specificity for detecting epilepsy that were above the agreed threshold.\nAlthough the evidence was restricted to adults, the committee were confident that this\ncould also be applied to diagnosis in children and young people. Witness reports and\nreview of video footage were included as useful additional features of the clinical history.\nThe evidence did not show sufficient diagnostic accuracy to warrant the use of witness\nreports or video footage independently, but the committee agreed that they increase the\naccuracy of expert clinical diagnosis.\nThe committee agreed, based on their knowledge and experience, that a positive\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) can identify cardiac causes of seizure-like symptoms, and a\nnegative ECG can support a further investigation of suspected epilepsy. Similarly, they\nagreed that the assessment of metabolic disturbances, such as hypoglycaemia can help to\nexclude alternative causes of a first seizure.\nAlthough none of the imaging modalities were sufficiently accurate for use as diagnostic\ntools, the committee agreed that neuroimaging should be used to investigate potential\nstructural causes of epilepsy.\nElectroencephalogram (EEG)\nThe evidence showed low sensitivity for routine interictal EEG, suggesting that many\npeople with epilepsy will not demonstrate interictal EEG abnormalities. The committee\ntherefore agreed that a negative routine interictal EEG should not be used to exclude an\nepilepsy diagnosis. However, the specificity was high enough for a positive EEG finding to\nsupport a provisional diagnosis of epilepsy. Most people without epilepsy will not have\nEEG abnormalities, so a person with a positive finding on EEG is more likely to have\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 95 of\nconditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nepilepsy than not. The committee agreed that routine EEG should therefore be considered\nto help support clinical diagnoses of epilepsy. The committee also agreed, based on\nclinical knowledge and experience, that EEG would provide more accurate results if done\nas soon as possible (ideally within 72 hours) after the seizure.\nSome evidence also suggested that provoking manoeuvres or longer-term EEG (for\nexample, during a period of sleep or ambulatory EEG over 48 hours) could slightly increase\nsensitivity. Although this small increase in sensitivity would be insufficient to exclude\ndiagnoses if EEG findings are negative, it might help to further support the overall clinical\ndiagnosis of epilepsy. The committee agreed that provoking manoeuvres during an EEG or,\nfor example, sleep deprivation to capture sleep EEG, could be offered if agreed with the\nperson being tested (or their family or carers). If routine and sleep-deprived EEG are\nnormal, the committee agreed that longer-term monitoring with ambulatory EEG could be\nconsidered for some people. This may be particularly indicated in people who are thought\nto have a focal epilepsy. The committee highlighted the potential harms of these methods\nand agreed that the risks and benefits should be fully discussed with the person and their\nfamilies or carers before performing the relevant EEG test.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nNo impact on practice is expected, because these recommendations do not substantially\nchange current practice.\nReturn to recommendations\nNeuroimaging\nRecommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.7\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nInitial imaging scans\nNeuroimaging may help to identify the cause of epilepsy, inform prognosis and can give\ninformation to plan appropriate management. However, the committee agreed that it is\nunnecessary for people with epilepsy that is not associated with structural brain\nabnormalities, such as idiopathic generalised epilepsy or self-limited epilepsy with\n© NICE 2025.

The evidence for different protocols was\nnot reviewed, so based on awareness of the wider literature, the committee decided that\nregionally agreed epilepsy protocols should be followed, using sequences available on\nmost modern MRI scanners, to capture enough detail. The committee stressed the\nimportance of carrying out scans early to inform timely management choices, and\ndiscussed variation in current practice, with some people having to wait several weeks.\nThey agreed that imaging should take place as soon as possible and specified a wait of no\nlonger than 6 weeks from referral for the MRI, in line with the pledge on waiting times for\ndiagnostic tests in the Handbook to the NHS Constitution for England.\nThe committee acknowledged that there may be situations when MRI is not suitable and\nCT should be offered instead, for example, if a person has severe claustrophobia or a non-\nMRI conditional pacemaker.\nReporting and reviewing scans\nSuccessful interpretation of MRI findings depends on the reader's proficiency, so the\ncommittee agreed, based on their experience, that scans should be reported by a\nradiologist with expertise in neuroradiology. Tertiary neuroradiology centres have\nexpertise in performing and interpreting MRI scans, so further review by these specialist\ncentres may be warranted if the diagnosis is in doubt or the person has drug-resistant\nepilepsy.\nRepeat scanning\nBased on their experience, the committee agreed on certain situations for which repeat\nMRI in people with an established epilepsy diagnosis may be important. For example, to\nlook for change in lesions in people with new symptoms, such as rapid cognitive decline or\nunexplained increase in seizure frequency. Repeat MRI may also be used to help locate the\nareas of the brain responsible for seizures if surgery is being considered.\nScanning in acute situations\nBased on their experience and expertise, the committee agreed that a CT scan can help\ndetermine whether a new-onset seizure is caused by an acute neurological lesion or\n© NICE 2025.

However, being aware that people with\nan established diagnosis of epilepsy who present to an emergency department with a\nseizure often have a CT scan, the committee emphasised that this is not needed for those\nwho have a typical seizure if there are no other clinical concerns.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe use of neuroimaging varies in current practice, and is not routinely used in all settings.\nThe recommendations will reduce variation in current practice. There may be an increase\nin the number of people who have neuroimaging. However, with the use of regionally\nagreed protocols, the detection of abnormalities may avoid the need for more scans in the\nfuture.\nReturn to recommendations\nGenetic testing\nRecommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.5\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee agreed that a discussion with a neurologist or geneticist may be needed to\nadvise on who to test and which type of test to use if there are uncertainties. Access to\ngenetic testing varies but is likely to increase. The committee noted that the NHS National\nGenomic Test Directory for rare and inherited disease lists the genetic tests for epilepsy\nthat are nationally commissioned by the NHS in England, and when they should be\nperformed.\nA genetic diagnosis can provide information about treatment options, related medical\nproblems and prognosis. It can also inform genetic counselling for the person and their\nfamily members. The committee discussed the importance of genetic counselling to\nensure that people, and their families or carers if appropriate, are supported to understand\nthe possible results of testing and what they might mean for them and their family. Results\ncan reveal information about the person who is being tested, but also their family\nmembers, which may have emotional and social consequences.\nThe committee agreed that a full discussion of the purpose and implications of genetic\n© NICE 2025.

Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and- Page 98 of\nconditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\ntesting is needed before testing, so that the person, and their family or carers if\nappropriate, can make decisions about testing and give informed consent. Informed\nconsent needs to be documented and it involves a full discussion about the benefits and\npossible limitations and risks of genetic testing, as well as consent to share information,\nwhere appropriate, about the results to advise the person's relatives.\nThe evidence did not support genetic testing for all people with epilepsy, so the\ncommittee took a pragmatic approach and agreed that testing should be considered in\nsituations most likely to yield positive diagnostic results. The committee agreed that there\nwas not enough evidence to recommend genetic testing at a specific point in the clinical\npathway.\nPeople whose epilepsy started at an early age (under 2 years) and people whose epilepsy\nis associated with developmental disorders or certain clinical features are more likely to\nhave epilepsy with a genetic cause. Therefore, based on their knowledge and experience,\nthe committee agreed that whole-genome sequencing would be best targeted to this\npopulation. This is in line with the eligibility criteria that accompany the NHS National\nGenomic Test Directory (clinical indication R59: early-onset or syndromic epilepsy).\nThe diagnostic yield of genetic testing in people with epilepsy of unknown cause with\nonset between 2 and 3 years is affected by factors such as co-occurring conditions and\nMRI and EEG findings. The committee noted that a genetic diagnosis in this group of\npeople can have a significant positive impact on outcomes and management, therefore,\nbased on their knowledge and experience and as specified by the NHS National Genomic\nTest Directory, they agreed that whole-genome sequencing should be carried out if\nagreed by a specialist multidisciplinary team.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe use of genetic testing varies in current practice, and it is not routinely carried out even\nwhen a genetic cause is suspected. The recommendations clarify when genetic testing\nshould be considered, which will reduce variation in current practice. There may be an\nincrease in the number of people who have a genetic test and who are referred for genetic\ncounselling. However, with the use of whole-genome sequencing, there may also be a\nreduction in the number of people having unnecessary tests that do not provide additional\ninformation on their diagnosis.\nReturn to recommendations\n© NICE 2025.

However, the committee discussed antibody testing in the\ncontext of suspected autoimmune encephalitis in people with new-onset epilepsy because\nit is recognised that people with autoimmune encephalitis can present with seizures or\nstatus epilepticus with encephalopathy. Although not part of the evidence review, the\ncommittee was aware that treatment guided by antibody testing (immunotherapy) may\nimprove outcomes in these people compared with standard antiseizure medication.\nThere is emerging evidence on 'autoimmune epilepsy', but the committee agreed that\nfurther research is needed to assess which immunomodulation strategies are effective in\npeople with defined autoimmune epilepsy syndromes. The committee agreed that further\nresearch is needed and developed a recommendation for research on immunomodulation\nstrategies for people with autoimmune epilepsy syndromes to help inform future guidance.\nHow the recommendation might affect practice\nSuspected autoimmune encephalitis is relatively rare and antibody testing is already\ncurrent practice, so the recommendation reinforces current best practice.\nReturn to recommendation\nInformation and support\nRecommendations 2.1.1 to 2.1.11\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nThe evidence showed that there are gaps in current practice in communication and in the\ninformation and support available to people with epilepsy.\nThe committee agreed that tailored information should be provided to people with\n© NICE 2025.

The evidence reported that some people with\nepilepsy and some parents and carers felt that information was withheld, making it difficult\nto be fully involved in their care. It also showed that children and young people wanted to\nbe involved but sometimes struggled to understand information inappropriate for their age,\nincluding information about sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The committee\nstressed the importance of providing age-appropriate information to enable children to be\ninvolved in discussions about their care. Extra support and time in consultations for people\nwith learning disabilities or complex needs, such as other comorbidities, were also\nhighlighted by the committee.\nThe committee highlighted the important role that epilepsy specialist nurses play in\ninformation giving. This was supported by the evidence and recommendations on epilepsy\nspecialist nurses.\nThe evidence showed that parents and carers struggled to find help from sources other\nthan their doctor. The committee acknowledged that information on where and how\npeople with epilepsy can access information and support for activities of daily living, such\nas local and national support groups, should be provided.\nThe committee stressed the importance of providing key information for self-managing\nepilepsy during the first appointment. Medicines adherence, mitigating epilepsy-related\nrisk and avoiding potential provoking factors for seizures were identified as key topics from\nthe evidence to enable the person to self-manage their epilepsy and maintain everyday\nactivities. Based on their experience, the committee also included activities of daily living,\nincluding driving, as a key topic for discussion because it is commonly raised as a concern\nat the first appointment. The committee agreed that this key information should be\nrepeated at subsequent appointments.\nThe committee recognised that people with epilepsy may have a range of worries and\nanxieties that may change over time, and that opportunities should be provided to discuss\nthese at each appointment. They agreed on some topics that are often of concern to\npeople with epilepsy and their families and carers, based on their experience and themes\nidentified in the evidence, which could be used to help provide a framework for\ndiscussions.\n© NICE 2025.

The committee noted that people are already using\ndevices, such as night monitors and alarms, as self-management tools, but that evidence\nis lacking to support this use, and these are not currently offered by the NHS. Based on\ntheir experience, the committee acknowledged that some monitoring tools may offer\nbenefit to people with epilepsy.\nThere is a trend towards the use of digital health technologies and the committee were\nkeen to encourage more research in this emerging and potentially important area. A\nrecommendation for research on digital health technologies was developed to help\ndetermine their clinical and cost effectiveness for people with epilepsy in the hope that\nthese interventions could lead to improvements in self-management.\nReturn to recommendation for research\nReferral to tertiary specialist services\nRecommendations 3.1.1 to 3.1.4\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nThere was a lack of evidence on referral to specialist services, so the committee based\ntheir recommendations on their clinical experience and expertise, and also used the NHS\nEngland 2019 guidance for referral pathways to specialist services for adults as a\nreference.\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms- Page 102 of\nand-conditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nChildren, young people and adults may need access to tertiary services at certain times\nduring their care and these services should be available to everyone who needs them\nthrough their specialist. However, the committee acknowledged that some groups may\nneed extra tertiary support to manage their epilepsy, even if they are already receiving\ncare from other specialists for another condition. The committee noted that people with a\nlearning disability or mental health problem may struggle to access tertiary services and\nmay need help to get appropriate referrals. They may also need additional support to\nattend appointments, such as having a family member or carer accompany them.\nWith the number of referrals increasing, the committee agreed that clearer and more\nspecific criteria for referral would help to ensure that people who will benefit most from\nspecialist services are prioritised. The proposed criteria aim to ensure that people with\nepilepsy that is difficult to diagnose or manage receive the specialist care and treatment\nthey need, including consideration for clinical trials. The committee recommended, based\non their knowledge and expertise, that people with epilepsy meeting these criteria should\nbe seen within 4 weeks. The committee agreed that these are people with substantial\nhealth needs, so prompt referral could have a significant positive impact on their\nprognosis. This is in line with current clinical practice and consistent with the previous\nversion of the guideline, so it is not expected to have an impact on resources. The\ncommittee agreed to retain and update the recommendation from the previous guideline\nbecause it was important to continue to guide clinicians to improve care and to reduce\nvariation in service provision and outcomes between services.\nThe committee also discussed particular groups of children that should be prioritised for\nmore urgent referral within 2 weeks. This was based on the committee's knowledge and\nexperience, and on the probability that treatment from a tertiary paediatric epilepsy\nservice would significantly benefit children meeting these criteria. They agreed that all\nchildren under 3 years should be referred to tertiary services without delay, because of\nthe risk of developmental problems with some paediatric syndromes with onset before this\nage. Children with myoclonic seizures presenting aged up to 4 years should be referred\nbecause myoclonic seizures may start after 3 years and could indicate an underlying\nneurodegenerative disorder that may be treatable. Children with a unilateral structural\nlesion should be prioritised for immediate referral because this is likely to lead to\ndifficulties in seizure management and surgery may need to be considered early. The\npresence of deterioration in the child's behaviour, speech or learning (such as loss of\npreviously acquired developmental milestones), particularly in the absence of an\nestablished diagnosis, should also be a priority for prompt investigation in tertiary\nservices.\n© NICE 2025.

They are based on recommendations from the previous version of the guideline and\nhave been retained and updated because the committee agreed it was important to\ninclude them to guide clinicians to improve care.\nThe committee agreed on some general factors to consider once the diagnosis of epilepsy\nis confirmed to ensure that the best treatment is started, balancing the risks and benefits\nof the medicine with the lifestyle and choices of the person. For example, if a person is\nstarting university and the most effective medication can affect cognitive performance,\nthey may wish to choose a different option without these side effects. For some people,\ntheir seizure type may mean that a medicine that is faster-acting to reduce seizures might\nbe a priority. These factors should be discussed with the person with epilepsy (and their\nfamilies and carers if appropriate) in all settings where antiseizure medications may be\nprescribed and managed, including primary, secondary and tertiary care.\nThe committee agreed on some particular issues that should additionally be taken into\naccount when giving antiseizure medications in older people. This group presents with\nspecific considerations because of differences in clinical presentation and aetiology when\ncompared with younger people, particularly those with co-occurring conditions. Treatment\ncan be more difficult because of drug interactions, therefore other medications the person\nmay be taking should be taken into account. Additionally, care is needed in choosing the\nadequate initial dose and subsequent titration. The committee noted that following the\nNICE guideline on multimorbidity, which covers care optimisation in people with multiple\nlong-term conditions, may benefit people with epilepsy and 1 or more mental or physical\n© NICE 2025.

The committee agreed that a shared decision should be made with the\nperson to agree their individualised antiseizure medication treatment strategy.\nThe committee agreed on some principles if seizures continue after monotherapy\ntreatment, which included reviewing the diagnosis and trying monotherapy with another\nantiseizure medication to ensure that the most effective treatment strategy is being used.\nThe committee agreed that, when starting an alternative antiseizure medication, the dose\nof the new antiseizure medication should be slowly increased while the existing\nantiseizure medication is tapered off because this can reduce the risk of drug-related\nwithdrawal symptoms of the first medication and clinicians can monitor the correct dose\nof the second medication.\nIf alternative antiseizure medications prove to be unsuccessful, an add-on treatment\nshould be considered. Because of the possible interactions between antiseizure\nmedications, for example sodium valproate and lamotrigine, the committee agreed that\nadd-on therapies should be carefully titrated and people should be monitored for adverse\neffects and their medicines reviewed frequently.\nThe committee highlighted the importance of using the regimen that provides the best\nbalance in terms of effectiveness and tolerability of side effects, and that the benefits of\nrationalising medications (using a single medicine if possible and what to consider if this\nmonotherapy is unsuccessful) should be discussed with the person with epilepsy (and\ntheir families and carers if appropriate) to ensure people are not taking more medicines\nthan is necessary to reduce the impact of side effects.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will not change current practice, but will reinforce current best\npractice.\nReturn to recommendations\n© NICE 2025.

However, they agreed that some clinical features\nshould prompt early treatment after a first unprovoked seizure, such as if an examination\nshows the person has a neurological deficit or the EEG shows unequivocal epileptic\nactivity, which may indicate that the risk of recurrence is high. In some circumstances, for\nexample if there is a risk of loss of employment, further seizures may be unacceptable, so\nthe person or their family or carers may choose to start early treatment. A structural brain\nabnormality indicates that the brain is damaged, therefore prompt treatment may stop\nfurther seizures.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will not change current practice, but will reinforce current best\npractice.\nReturn to recommendations\nSafety considerations\nRecommendations 4.3.1 to 4.3.13\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nThese recommendations are based on the committee's informal consensus on safety\nconsiderations for starting antiseizure medication to treat all epilepsy syndromes and\nseizure types with antiseizure medication.\nAntiseizure medications differ significantly in their characteristics, therefore the risk of\n© NICE 2025.

The committee\nagreed that Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advice on\nswitching between different manufacturer's products needs to be followed.\nIn line with the BNF, the committee agreed clinicians should be aware of the risks of\nserious complications associated with phenytoin for people of Han Chinese or Thai family\nbackground, and the risks of serious complications associated with carbamazepine and\npotentially medicines with a similar chemical structure (such as oxcarbazepine and\neslicarbazepine acetate) for people of Han Chinese, Thai, European or Japanese family\nbackground.\nIn line with the MHRA, the committee noted the antiseizure medicines most commonly\nreported to cause decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of osteomalacia. The\ncommittee agreed that appropriate supplementation should be considered for those at\nrisk.\nIn January 2025, recommendation 4.3.5 was added because of updated MHRA regulations\non the use of valproate in men. The precautionary advice is based on 1 retrospective\nobservational study indicating a possible increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders\nin children born to men treated with valproate in the 3 months before conception,\ncompared with those born to men treated with lamotrigine or levetiracetam. While it is\nunknown whether valproate has a causal role, it is important to make people aware of this\nassociation.\nThe guideline committee wanted to ensure that women and girls with epilepsy had access\nto appropriate support and information about contraception, conception, pregnancy,\nbreastfeeding and caring for children, and menopause. They stressed the importance of\nhaving regular reviews with women and girls to ensure they had access to further\ninformation and treatment as their circumstances change.\nThe committee referred to the MHRA's Public Assessment Report of antiepileptic drugs:\nreview of safety of use during pregnancy to inform the recommendations. In January 2025,\nthe recommendations were amended to align with updated MHRA regulations on the use\nof sodium valproate and topiramate.

They agreed women and girls should be\nsupported to breastfeed if they wish, because the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the\nsmall risk of the drug affecting the child.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nServices providing reviews and support are thought to be under-commissioned at the\npresent time and so the recommendations are likely to have an impact on practice with an\nincrease in regular reviews. The MHRA safety advice may encourage people who are on\nantiseizure medications other than lamotrigine and levetiracetam to reconsider their\ntreatment options.\nReturn to recommendations\nMonitoring and review\nRecommendations 4.4.1 to 4.4.4\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nMonitoring reviews are essential to reassess the clinical management plans of people with\nepilepsy as their needs change. Evidence comparing regular scheduled reviews with\npatient-initiated ad-hoc reviews did not suggest any differences in benefit or harm\nbetween these approaches. The committee discussed that patient-initiated review could\nhelp to ensure timely management of changes in a person's needs and support their sense\nof ownership of managing their epilepsy. However, it would have disadvantages for people\nwith less independence or capacity to make decisions, and could lead to loss of contact\nwith services, with potentially serious consequences. It might also be unsuitable for\npeople with a serious or complex condition, for whom failing to contact services could be\nparticularly harmful.\nThe committee agreed that patient-initiated review should be available to all people with\n© NICE 2025.

Based on their experience, the committee agreed that groups\nscheduled for regular reviews should include people with reduced capacity for decision\nmaking, people with serious or complex epilepsy, those with serious comorbidities, and\nchildren and young people. They also identified people taking antiseizure medication\nassociated with long-term side effects or drug interactions as a priority to check for any\nadverse effects. Long-term side effects may include adverse effects on blood parameters\nor bone health, or changes in lipid metabolism. Enzyme-inducing medications in particular\nare associated with reduced bone density. Regular review for women and girls who are\nable to have children and are taking sodium valproate, topiramate or other high-risk\nteratogenic medication was also recommended to allow a discussion of their treatment\noptions and any plans for pregnancy. The committee commented that regular review is\ncurrent practice for children and young people, typically with 2 reviews a year and at least\nonce every 12 months.\nThe evidence comparing therapeutic drug monitoring with clinical review suggested there\nis little difference in benefit between these approaches. Based on their experience, the\ncommittee agreed that for most people with epilepsy, therapeutic drug monitoring is\nunnecessary, but that certain groups might gain particular benefit from it. These groups\ninclude people who need accurate titration of their medicine levels, such as those with\nside effects, whose seizures are not controlled with treatment and those in whom\nadherence is less assured. They also include people at particular risk from their\nmedication, because of either the intrinsic nature of the medication or the increased risks\nof the medication in people with comorbidities or who are pregnant (for example, to\nmonitor for changes in lamotrigine plasma levels during pregnancy and after birth).\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations may change practice because regular review is currently standard\npractice for all people with epilepsy. There was some concern that specialist nurse\nservices would need to be developed to coordinate patient-initiated reviews. However, the\ncommittee agreed that demand on services is likely to be manageable, provided that\nregular reviews are maintained for groups that might have additional need for coordination.\nRestricting therapeutic drug monitoring to a few specific groups will not place any extra\nburden on providers, and might even slightly reduce it.\nReturn to recommendations\n© NICE 2025.

The committee agreed that\nthe evidence was inconclusive, so the group based the recommendations on their own\nexperience and guidance from the MHRA about monitoring levels of carbamazepine,\nlamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin if used in\npregnancy. In January 2025, the guideline was updated because of precautionary MHRA\nadvice for men taking valproate who are planning a family within the next year. This states\nthat they should be made aware of the potential fertility risks and treatment options. To\nenable this advice to be given, a recommendation was added for referral to an epilepsy\nspecialist team so that men planning a family within the next year can discuss their\nmedication options.\nThe committee noted that on-site testing is often available at tertiary epilepsy centres for\nsome antiseizure medications, including carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital.\nThey acknowledged that phenytoin and phenobarbital are not usually taken by girls and\nwomen who are planning pregnancy. The committee also agreed that pre-conception\nmonitoring of antiseizure medication levels should be considered in women and girls at risk\nof their seizures worsening during pregnancy and made a recommendation based on\ncommittee consensus. The committee highlighted the importance of obtaining pre-\nconception levels of antiseizure medication as a baseline level to compare and titrate\nagainst when monitoring drug levels during pregnancy.\nThe committee expressed the need for robust evidence in this area and therefore\nsuggested a recommendation for research on monitoring antiseizure medications in\nwomen and girls.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee noted that currently there would be some women with epilepsy who are\nplanning pregnancy or who are pregnant who are not having their antiseizure medications\nmonitored. The recommendations are in line with MHRA safety advice on monitoring in\npregnancy, and may result in some increases in drug monitoring compared with current\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

Although there was some\nevidence for independent risk factors associated with seizure recurrence, the committee\nagreed that the recommendations should be broader than listing risk factors, which could\nbe misleading in isolation.\nOngoing risk and benefit assessment is important to take account of the evolving needs of\nthe person with epilepsy. Based on their knowledge and experience, the committee\nagreed that an individualised assessment of the risk of seizure recurrence should be\ncarried out in those who have been 2 years without seizures. The committee stressed the\nimportance of having a discussion with the person, and their family or carer if appropriate,\nabout their personal preferences and the person's individual risk of seizure recurrence, in\nparticular taking into account the type of epilepsy, so that the person is able to make an\ninformed decision about their care. For example, stopping antiseizure medication in people\nwith certain epileptic syndromes, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, structural\nabnormalities or with co-existing neurodegenerative and other neurological conditions will\npose a significant risk of seizure recurrence.\nThe committee agreed that guidance should be sought if there are doubts or concerns\nabout the risks and benefits of discontinuing antiseizure medications. Because of the\ncomplexity and wide variation of epilepsy surgery techniques, the committee agreed that\nthose who have undergone epilepsy surgery should have antiseizure medications\ndiscontinued under the guidance of the epilepsy surgery centre.\nThe committee highlighted the importance of stopping antiseizure medications slowly,\nespecially benzodiazepines and barbiturates, because of the possibility of drug-related\nwithdrawal symptoms. They also agreed that epilepsy specialist guidance would be\nneeded if seizures recur.\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

During such\nseizures, consciousness is lost and muscles will stiffen before jerking rhythmically.\nThe evidence showed that, for time to treatment failure, no drugs performed better than\nsodium valproate, with sodium valproate showing clear benefits over lacosamide,\nphenobarbital, carbamazepine and topiramate. There was no clear difference between\nsodium valproate and all other drugs for remission or time to first seizure.\nIn January 2025, the recommendations were amended to align with updated MHRA\nregulations on the use of sodium valproate. Given the evidence that after sodium\nvalproate, lamotrigine or levetiracetam had the next best time to treatment failure, they are\nnow all options for first-line monotherapy treatment of generalised tonic-clonic seizures\ntaking into account the MHRA safety advice and regulatory position. In relation to\nreproductive risks with sodium valproate, MHRA safety measures in women and girls of\nchildbearing potential and precautionary advice for boys and men were highlighted to\nensure they are followed, discussed and reviewed.\nThe committee discussed the evidence on adverse events and their importance in making\nchoices about drug treatment. However, these were reported inconsistently across the\nstudies making comparisons between drugs difficult. The committee also agreed that for\nmost drugs, adverse events could be managed by careful titration and dosage changes.\nFrom the evidence, it was difficult to determine the most effective add-on drug for\ngeneralised tonic-clonic seizures that have failed to respond to monotherapy. Therefore, a\nnumber of drugs were recommended as potential first-line add-on treatments. There was\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

No evidence was identified for clobazam\nand sodium valproate, but the committee agreed to include them based on their\nexperience and current use in practice. In January 2025, the recommendations were\namended to align with updated MHRA regulations on the use of sodium valproate and\ntopiramate. The MHRA safety advice relating to women and girls of childbearing potential\nwho take topiramate was highlighted to ensure that the conditions of the Pregnancy\nPrevention Programme are fulfilled because of the risks of the medication on the unborn\nchild. There was also some evidence that levetiracetam and perampanel were more\neffective than placebo at achieving seizure freedom, but there was a lot of uncertainty\naround these results.\nThe evidence also suggested that brivaracetam might be more effective than placebo at\nachieving more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency, and lacosamide was less\neffective than levetiracetam for the same outcome. The committee therefore\nrecommended both brivaracetam and lacosamide, as well as phenobarbital, primidone and\nzonisamide, based on their experience and knowledge of current practice, as possible\nsecond-line add-on treatments.\nThe committee highlighted that clinicians should take into account that some drugs used\nin clinical practice can exacerbate seizures in those with absence or myoclonic seizures,\nincluding in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\nIn line with the MHRA, the committee emphasised that long-term treatment with primidone\nand sodium valproate can cause decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of\nosteomalacia. The committee noted that appropriate supplementation should be\nconsidered for those at risk.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations may result in the interventions to treat generalised tonic-clonic\nseizures being prescribed in a different order to current practice. Additional counselling,\nclinical opinion and administration will be needed when sodium valproate or topiramate are\nconsidered or used.\nReturn to recommendations\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

Symptoms vary widely depending on the area of the brain they\noriginate from.\nThe evidence showed that lamotrigine and levetiracetam were continued for longer than\nother drugs for treating focal epilepsy, suggesting that they may be more effective and\nbetter tolerated. However, the evidence also suggested they were not more effective than\nother drugs in terms of remission at 6 and 12 months, and the evidence for time to first\nseizure suggested they were less effective than carbamazepine.\nThe committee discussed the evidence on adverse events and their importance in making\nchoices about drug treatment. The evidence suggested that lamotrigine, levetiracetam\nand gabapentin may have more tolerable adverse events than other drugs. However,\nadverse events were reported inconsistently across the studies making comparisons\nbetween drugs difficult. The committee also agreed that for most drugs, adverse events\ncould be managed by careful titration and dosage changes.\nThe committee agreed that lamotrigine and levetiracetam should be considered as first-\nline monotherapy options, and this was supported by economic modelling. They agreed\nthat if these treatments were unsuccessful, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine or zonisamide\ncould be considered for second-line monotherapy. The evidence was weaker for\nlacosamide, so this was included as a third-line option.\nFrom the evidence, it was difficult to determine the most effective add-on treatment for\npeople with focal epilepsy that has failed to respond to monotherapy. The evidence\nshowed that a number of antiseizure medications are effective compared with placebo for\nmore than 50% reduction in seizure frequency rate: brivaracetam, carbamazepine,\neslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine,\nperampanel, pregabalin, topiramate and zonisamide.

The committee agreed the use of cenobamate as an add-on treatment,\nafter at least 1 other add-on antiseizure medication, has been unsuccessful, in line with\nNICE's technology appraisal guidance on cenobamate for treating focal-onset seizures in\nepilepsy.\nAs with the evidence for monotherapy, the evidence on adverse events with add-on\ntherapy was inconsistent and the committee were not able to use it to inform the\nrecommendations.\nAlthough the evidence was less clear, the committee agreed that, based on their\nexperience, sodium valproate can also be an effective option. In January 2025, the\nrecommendations were amended to align with updated MHRA regulations on the use of\nsodium valproate. Sodium valproate was moved to a third-line add-on treatment option for\nfocal seizures. In relation to reproductive risks with sodium valproate, MHRA safety\nmeasures in women and girls of childbearing potential and precautionary advice for boys\nand men were highlighted to ensure these are followed, discussed and reviewed.\nThere was a lack of evidence for other antiseizure medications, but based on the\ncommittee's experience, phenobarbital, phenytoin and vigabatrin were recommended only\nwhen the previous treatments are not tolerated or are unsuccessful, for example because\nof the risk of particular adverse effects.\nThe committee noted that, in line with guidance from the MHRA, clinicians should be\naware of the risks of serious complications associated with phenytoin for people of Han\nChinese or Thai family background, and the risks of serious complications associated with\ncarbamazepine, and potentially medicines with a similar chemical structure (such as\noxcarbazepine and eslicarbazepine acetate) for people of Han Chinese, Thai, European or\nJapanese family background.\nIn addition, in line with the MHRA, the committee emphasised that long-term treatment\nwith carbamazepine, phenytoin and sodium valproate can cause decreased bone mineral\ndensity and increased risk of osteomalacia. The committee noted that appropriate\nsupplementation should be considered for those at risk.\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

Previous NICE guidance\nrecommended lamotrigine and carbamazepine for first-line monotherapy, with restrictions\non the use of levetiracetam owing to costs. Levetiracetam is now significantly cheaper and\nwidely prescribed in the NHS. These recommendations may lead to a small increase in the\nuse of levetiracetam, but this will not lead to a significant increase in costs.\nThe recommendations may result in a different order of prescribing add-on treatments\nsuch as valproate and topiramate. Additional counselling, clinical opinion and\nadministration will be needed when these are considered or used.\nAll drugs recommended as add-on treatments are already widely used. Gabapentin and\nclobazam are no longer recommended, which may lead to a small decrease in the use of\nthese drugs. However, these drugs are not widely used and are likely to be continued in\npeople who are already using them successfully.\nReturn to recommendations\nAbsence seizures\nRecommendations 5.3.1 to 5.3.6\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nAbsence seizures are a form of generalised epileptic seizure, characterised by a lack of\nawareness, stopping moving or talking and staring blankly. They can occur in isolation, but\ncan also be associated epilepsy syndromes, such as childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile\nabsence epilepsy and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The evidence identified was only on\nchildren and young people; however, the committee agreed that it was appropriate to\nextrapolate from this evidence to the adult population because of the similar\npathophysiology in children, young people and adults.\nAbsence seizures (including childhood absence epilepsy)\nThe limited evidence suggested that ethosuximide may improve outcomes for absence\nseizures (including childhood absence epilepsy). It also suggested that ethosuximide may\nincrease the likelihood of remission, which is the main objective of treatment for people\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

The committee agreed that, despite a lack of robust evidence, their\nexpertise and experience supported the use of ethosuximide as first-line treatment for\nabsence seizures. The committee noted that ethosuximide treatment may lead to\nimproved cognitive outcomes and is already well established in clinical practice.\nThe committee agreed that sodium valproate should be offered as second-line\nmonotherapy or add-on treatment for absence seizures because the evidence suggested\nthat it may increase the likelihood of remission and it appears to be associated with fewer\nadverse events than other drugs reviewed. The evidence also suggested that lamotrigine\nand levetiracetam were effective in treating absence seizures and therefore should also be\noffered as second-line monotherapy or add-on treatment for absence seizures.\nIn January 2025, the recommendations were amended to align with updated MHRA\nregulations on the use of sodium valproate. Sodium valproate, levetiracetam and\nlamotrigine are now all options for second-line monotherapy or add-on treatment for\nabsence seizures. In relation to reproductive risks with sodium valproate, MHRA safety\nmeasures in women and girls of childbearing potential and precautionary advice for boys\nand men were highlighted to ensure they are followed, discussed and reviewed. In line\nwith the MHRA, the committee emphasised that long-term treatment with sodium\nvalproate can cause decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of osteomalacia.\nThe committee noted that appropriate supplementation should be considered for those at\nrisk.\nThe committee agreed that although other antiseizure medications are used in clinical\npractice and may benefit some people, it should be highlighted that some can exacerbate\nseizures.\nAbsence seizures with other seizure types\nThe evidence showed that sodium valproate is associated with a higher likelihood of\nremission and is well tolerated, so the committee agreed that it should be considered as\nfirst-line treatment for absence seizures with other seizure types (or at risk of other\nseizure types). In January 2025, the recommendations were amended to align with\nupdated MHRA regulations on the use of sodium valproate.

Because no evidence was\nidentified on monotherapy or first-line treatments for myoclonic seizures, the committee\nagreed that it was appropriate to extrapolate from the evidence reviewed on generalised\ntonic-clonic seizures. Based on this, the committee agreed that while sodium valproate is\nthe most effective treatment option for myoclonic seizures compared with other\nantiseizure medications, levetiracetam was also effective. In January 2025, the\nrecommendations were amended to align with updated MHRA regulations on the use of\nsodium valproate.

Additional counselling, clinical opinion\nand administration will be needed when sodium valproate is used.\nReturn to recommendations\nTonic or atonic seizures\nRecommendations 5.5.1 to 5.5.6\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nTonic or atonic seizures are events that may cause a person to suddenly drop to the floor.\nThese may be the result of atonic (generalised loss of tone) or tonic (sustained\ngeneralised body stiffening) seizures. Although these are characteristic of Lennox–Gastaut\nsyndrome, they are also seen in other epilepsy syndromes and aetiologies. They often\nresult in injury and can therefore have a significant impact on quality of life.\nBecause of the complexities associated with the treatment of tonic or atonic seizures and\nthe range of syndromes of which they can be a feature, the committee agreed that a\nneurologist with expertise in epilepsy should assess people with these seizures in order to\nprovide accurate diagnoses if possible and advise on further investigations as well as\ntreatment.\nTonic or atonic seizures are classified as generalised seizures. Because no evidence was\nidentified on monotherapy or first-line treatments for tonic or atonic seizures, the\ncommittee agreed that it was appropriate to extrapolate from the evidence on generalised\ntonic-clonic seizures.

In January 2025, the recommendations were amended to align\nwith updated MHRA regulations on the use of sodium valproate.

The committee noted that appropriate supplementation should be\nconsidered for those at risk.\nThere was some evidence that lamotrigine, when used as an add-on therapy, is effective\nin controlling tonic and atonic seizures or drop attacks, so the committee agreed that it\ncould be considered as first-line treatment for women and girls who are able to have\nchildren.\nHowever, the committee also agreed that for some women and girls who are able to have\nchildren, sodium valproate may still be an option, but only if the risks and benefits have\nbeen thoroughly discussed, other treatments are unsuccessful and safety advice from the\nMHRA is followed. This should be a shared decision taken by the person with epilepsy and\ntheir healthcare professional.\nThe evidence indicated that clobazam, rufinamide and topiramate can also be effective in\nthe management of tonic and atonic seizures and the committee recommended that any\nof these antiseizure medications could be used as a second-line monotherapy or add-on\ntreatment. In the absence of clear cost-effectiveness evidence of superiority between the\ndifferent options, the committee agreed that clinicians should use their knowledge and\nexperience to determine which treatment is most appropriate for the person with epilepsy,\ntaking into account clinical factors and the person's preference.

These are\nwell defined, and onset is usually in adolescence, although it can begin in childhood.\nSeizures will continue into middle age, after which there is some evidence that these will\nremit, but is not possible to predict in which people this will occur. Many have a good\nprognosis for seizure control with antiseizure medications and treatment goal is seizure\nfreedom.\nThe evidence showed that sodium valproate is the most effective treatment for idiopathic\ngeneralised epilepsies compared with other antiseizure medications. There was some\nevidence that levetiracetam is of benefit as add-on therapy compared with placebo. The\nevidence also showed that lamotrigine was associated with fewer side effects leading to\ntreatment stopping and better health-related quality of life than sodium valproate.

The committee noted that appropriate supplementation should be\nconsidered for those at risk.\nThe evidence showed that both lamotrigine and levetiracetam were effective at reducing\nseizures, and the committee agreed that they should be options for first-line treatment in\nwomen and girls who are able to have children, and for younger girls with epilepsy likely to\ncontinue beyond puberty.\nThe committee agreed it was important to stress that for some women and girls who are\nable to have children, sodium valproate may still be an option, but only if the risks and\nbenefits have been thoroughly discussed, other treatments are unsuccessful and safety\nadvice from the MHRA is followed. This should be a shared decision taken by the person\nwith epilepsy and their healthcare professional.\nThe included studies did not show a clinically important benefit for topiramate when\ncompared with placebo or valproate; however, the committee noted that this drug is useful\nin clinical practice. The evidence showed that add-on perampanel is effective for reducing\nseizures and therefore, based on their expert opinion and the evidence reviewed\nrespectively, the committee agreed that these drugs should be available as a second-line\nadd-on treatment option.

Children present with\nprolonged febrile seizures, which may need admission to an intensive care unit. Dravet\nsyndrome can be difficult to diagnose in the first year of life; therefore, the committee\nemphasised that these recommendations only apply once the diagnosis has been\nconfirmed and discussed with a paediatric neurologist.\nDravet syndrome is complex to treat and the response to treatment is variable. Based on\ntheir experience and expertise, the committee agreed that the involvement of a\nneurologist with expertise in epilepsy is needed to guide the care of people with Dravet\nsyndrome.\nThere was no evidence for first-line treatments, so the committee based their\nrecommendations on clinical experience and expert opinion. The committee agreed that\nsodium valproate can be effective at reducing seizures in people with Dravet syndrome\nbecause it is successfully used in current practice to treat generalised epilepsies, including\nDravet syndrome. The committee acknowledged that sodium valproate should be used\nwith caution, only after the risks and benefits have been thoroughly discussed and in line\nwith safety advice from the MHRA. In January 2025, the guideline was updated to\nhighlight safety measures and precautionary advice related to updated MHRA regulations\non the use of sodium valproate. However, they agreed that sodium valproate should be\nconsidered as first-line treatment for all people with Dravet syndrome, because there are\nfew effective treatment options and treatment is often started at a young age (under\n2 years). In line with the MHRA, the committee emphasised that long-term treatment with\nsodium valproate can cause decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of\nosteomalacia. The committee noted that appropriate supplementation should be\nconsidered for those at risk.\nThe evidence suggested that triple therapy with sodium valproate, clobazam and\nstiripentol was effective at reducing seizures in children and young people whose seizures\nwere previously treated unsuccessfully with clobazam and sodium valproate in\n© NICE 2025.

Although the evidence was limited, the committee agreed that it supported\nthis as first-line add-on therapy. The committee also highlighted that careful titration of\ndoses and regular review are important because of possible adverse effects such as\nsedation.\nThe committee agreed that the NICE technology appraisal guidance on cannabidiol with\nclobazam for treating seizures associated with Dravet syndrome supports the use of this\ncombination as a second-line treatment option.\nThere was an absence of evidence to guide further treatment if seizures continue. The\ncommittee recommended further treatment options based on their experience and expert\nopinion, and agreed that these should be considered only under the supervision of a\nneurologist with expertise in epilepsy or a ketogenic diet team, as appropriate. The use of\npotassium bromide is unusual in practice, but the committee noted that for some people\nwith Dravet syndrome, it can be effective.\nThe committee were aware of ongoing trials, but agreed that further research on treating\nDravet syndrome when first-line therapy is unsuccessful or not tolerated would be\nbeneficial and they developed a recommendation for research on complex epilepsy\nsyndromes to help inform future guidance.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations will not change current practice, but will reinforce best practice.\nReturn to recommendations\nLennox–Gastaut syndrome\nRecommendations 6.2.1 to 6.2.9\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nLennox–Gastaut syndrome is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with\nonset in childhood. It can be difficult to diagnose, so children may be started on\nantiseizure medication before a final diagnosis is established.\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

The committee agreed that\nsodium valproate can be effective in suppressing seizures in people with Lennox–Gastaut\nsyndrome because it is successfully used in current practice to treat generalised epilepsy,\nincluding Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. They acknowledged that sodium valproate should be\nused with caution, and only if the risks and benefits have been thoroughly discussed and\nsafety advice from the MHRA is followed. However, they agreed that it should be\nconsidered as first-line treatment for all people with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome because\nthere are few effective treatment options and treatment is often started at a young age\n(under 2 years). In January 2025, the guideline was updated to highlight safety measures\nand precautionary advice related to updated MHRA regulations on the use of sodium\nvalproate. In line with the MHRA, the committee emphasised that long-term treatment with\nsodium valproate can cause decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of\nosteomalacia. The committee noted that appropriate supplementation should be\nconsidered for those at risk.\nThe evidence showed that when used as an add-on treatment, lamotrigine is effective for\nreducing seizures and drop attacks, therefore the committee agreed that it could be used\nas second-line therapy, as either an add-on or monotherapy treatment if treatment was\nnot successful or first-line therapy is not tolerated. If used as an add-on therapy, the\ncommittee recommended lower initial doses and caution in titration, in line with the BNF.\nThis is because of interactions between sodium valproate and lamotrigine.\nThere was some evidence that clobazam, rufinamide and topiramate were of benefit in\nreducing seizure frequency and drop attacks when used as add-on therapy compared with\na placebo. In addition, the NICE technology appraisal guidance on cannabidiol with\nclobazam for treating seizures associated with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome supports the\nuse of this combination as a further treatment option. Therefore, the committee agreed\nthat any of these treatment options could be considered as an add-on treatment if first-\nand second-line therapy are not tolerated or if seizures continue.

Based on experience and expertise, the committee agreed that guidance\nshould be sought immediately from a tertiary paediatric neurologist, followed by referral if\nneeded. If untreated, long-term risks of infantile spasms include poor neurodevelopmental\noutcomes, which could be a serious safety concern. Based on their experience and\nexpertise, the committee stressed that prompt diagnosis and treatment is associated with\nan improved prognosis.

Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms- Page 127 of\nand-conditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nstudies included in the review, the committee agreed that these children should be\nmonitored both during and after treatment for the relapse of spasms and the emergence\nof other seizure types, as well as for possible side effects related to treatment.\nThe evidence suggested that first-line treatment combining steroids with vigabatrin is\nmore effective than either steroids or vigabatrin alone in stopping spasms. There was no\nclear evidence about whether oral or injectable steroids were better, but the committee\nagreed that oral steroids would be easier to use.\nBased on their expert opinion, the committee agreed that steroids may not be suitable for\nall children under 2 years and that vigabatrin alone should be considered for those at high\nrisk from the side effects of steroid treatment, such as those with neurological\nimpairments and other comorbidities.\nThere was evidence that vigabatrin alone is effective for children with infantile spasms\nassociated with tuberous sclerosis, so the committee agreed that it should be used as\nfirst-line treatment in these children, with high-dose oral prednisolone added on if\nvigabatrin is ineffective after 1 week.\nThe committee agreed that there should be a discussion between parents and carers of\nchildren under 2 years taking steroids and their healthcare professional, and that\ninformation should be given about possible side effects, such as the increased risk of\ninfection, high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels. Information should include, for\nexample, how to reduce exposure to infections such as chickenpox and what to do if the\nchild may have been exposed.\nThe evidence showed that higher doses of both vigabatrin and oral steroids gave\nimproved freedom from spasms, so the committee agreed that dosages should be\nincreased in line with the guidance in the BNF for children. Based on their expert opinion,\nthe committee agreed that it may be necessary to go above the specified doses of\nvigabatrin if the spasms do not stop, but this should be carried out with specialist\nsupervision.\nThere was an absence of robust evidence to guide second-line treatments. The committee\nagreed possible options based on expert opinion and experience, which should be guided\nand supervised by a tertiary paediatric neurologist experienced in the care of these\nchildren.\n© NICE 2025.

Some only have infrequent seizures, which have little impact on wellbeing.\nTherefore, not all children and young people and their families will choose antiseizure\nmedication treatment. The committee acknowledged the importance of discussing the\nbalance of risks and benefits of treatment compared with no treatment, with the child or\nyoung person and their family or carers, and agreed on some important factors that should\nform part of a full discussion about treatment. They also agreed that the risk of sudden\nunexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) should be discussed, and reassurance given that\nthis is very rare.\nThe committee members were confident, based on their experience and knowledge, that\ncurrent practice using antiseizure medications is effective at controlling seizures in\nchildren and young people with self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes.\nThere was a lack of evidence on antiseizure medications for self-limited epilepsy with\ncentrotemporal spikes, but because these children and young people usually have focal\nseizures, the committee agreed to use the evidence on monotherapy for treating focal\nseizures to inform the recommendations for first- and second-line treatments. This\nevidence showed that lamotrigine and levetiracetam were continued for longer than other\ndrugs for treating focal epilepsy, suggesting that they may be more effective and better\n© NICE 2025.

However, the evidence also suggested they were not more effective than other\ndrugs in terms of remission at 6 and 12 months, and the evidence for time to first seizure\nsuggested they were less effective than carbamazepine.\nThe evidence on focal seizures suggested that lamotrigine, levetiracetam and gabapentin\nmay have more tolerable adverse events than other drugs. However, adverse events were\nreported inconsistently across the studies making comparisons between drugs difficult.\nThe committee also agreed that, for most drugs, adverse events could be managed by\ncareful titration and dosage changes.\nBased on the evidence for focal seizures, the committee agreed that lamotrigine and\nlevetiracetam should be considered as first-line treatment options, and carbamazepine,\noxcarbazepine or zonisamide as second-line monotherapy treatments.\nThe committee noted that, in line with guidance from the MHRA, clinicians should be\naware of the risks of serious complications associated with carbamazepine and potentially\nmedicines with a similar chemical structure (such as oxcarbazepine and eslicarbazepine\nacetate) for people of Han Chinese, Thai, European or Japanese family background.\nIn addition, in line with the MHRA, the committee emphasised that long-term treatment\nwith carbamazepine can cause decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of\nosteomalacia. The committee noted that appropriate supplementation should be\nconsidered for those at risk.\nThe evidence on self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes showed that sulthiame is\neffective for reducing seizures, and so the committee agreed that it should also be\navailable. However, the evidence was limited in quantity and sulthiame is not currently\nlicensed in the UK, so the committee decided that it should be considered as a third-line\ntreatment if licensed options are unsuccessful, and only in consultation with a tertiary\npaediatric neurologist.\nThe committee noted that in their experience, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and\nlamotrigine are sometimes associated with increased seizures or the development of\nanother epilepsy syndrome. The committee recognised that only a small number of\nchildren are likely to be affected by these problems, but agreed that any change should\nprompt a sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) to exclude developmental epileptic\nencephalopathy with spike-wave activation in sleep, which may indicate an atypical form\nof self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. The committee agreed that poor\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

Regular reviews are important to prevent children and young people\ncontinuing on unnecessary treatment and allow discussion of stopping treatment. The\ncommittee agreed that this should usually happen when the child has been seizure-free\nfor 2 years or at age 14 years.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations are not likely to change current practice, but should reinforce best\npractice.\nReturn to recommendations\nEpilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures (Doose\nsyndrome)\nRecommendations 6.5.1 to 6.5.7\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nEpilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures is a rare condition in young children. Successful\ntreatment depends on accurate diagnosis, so based on their experience and expertise, the\ncommittee agreed that a tertiary paediatric neurologist should advise on management.\nNo evidence was identified on treating epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures. Based on\ntheir experience, the committee agreed that levetiracetam and sodium valproate should be\nconsidered as first-line treatment options because they are used effectively in current\npractice to treat generalised epilepsy, including epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures.\nThe committee acknowledged that sodium valproate should be used with caution, only\nafter the risks and benefits have been thoroughly discussed, other treatments are\nunsuccessful and MHRA safety advice is followed. However, they agreed that sodium\nvalproate should be considered as a first-line treatment option for epilepsy with\nmyoclonic-atonic seizures, with regular review of the risks and benefits, because there are\nfew effective treatment options available, treatment is often started at a young age and\n© NICE 2025.

In January 2025, the\nguideline was updated to highlight safety measures and precautionary advice related to\nupdated MHRA regulations on the use of sodium valproate. In line with the MHRA, the\ncommittee emphasised that long-term treatment with sodium valproate can cause\ndecreased bone mineral density and increased risk of osteomalacia. The committee noted\nthat appropriate supplementation should be considered for those at risk.\nThe committee were aware of studies that showed benefits of a ketogenic diet in these\nchildren, and based on this knowledge and their experience, agreed that this should be\nconsidered as a second-line add-on or alternative treatment, under the supervision of a\nketogenic diet team.\nIn the absence of evidence, the committee discussed their experience and knowledge of\nother antiseizure medications for epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures. They agreed\nthat clobazam, ethosuximide, topiramate and zonisamide may be effective. However,\nthese medicines are less commonly used than the first-line treatments, so the committee\ndecided that they could be considered only if first- and second-line options are\nunsuccessful. In January 2025, the guideline was updated to highlight MHRA safety advice\nrelating to women and girls of childbearing potential taking topiramate to ensure that the\nconditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are fulfilled because of the risks of the\nmedication on the unborn child.\nThe committee wanted to make it clear that carbamazepine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine,\nphenytoin, pregabalin and vigabatrin should not be used for epilepsy with myoclonic-\natonic seizures, because they are known to increase the frequency of seizures in this type\nof epilepsy.\nChildren can grow out of epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures, so the committee\ndiscussed discontinuing treatment. Based on their experience, they agreed that this\nshould be considered if the child is seizure-free for 2 years.\nThe committee agreed that further research is needed on treating epilepsy with\nmyoclonic-atonic seizures when first-line therapy is unsuccessful or not tolerated and\ndeveloped a recommendation for research on complex epilepsy syndromes to help inform\nfuture guidance.\n© NICE 2025.

The committee noted the importance of an agreed, individualised\nemergency management plan for people with epilepsy that should be followed for people\nexperiencing status epilepticus. The management plan should include details of any\nemergency medicine that has been prescribed, who is trained to use it and when to give it.\nThe evidence showed an overall benefit for benzodiazepines, but no clear evidence to\nsupport a particular drug. The committee agreed that the speed of delivery is more\nimportant than the type of benzodiazepine, and that the route of administration is likely to\ndepend on whether the drug is being given in the community or in a hospital. In community\nsettings, medicines are usually given in buccal or rectal forms because intravenous access\nis not available. The committee discussed that intravenous lorazepam is routinely given in\nhospitals and agreed that it should be the first-choice treatment in this setting because of\nits rapid action and because it causes less respiratory depression and sedation than other\ndrugs. Buccal midazolam is currently used in the community, and based on their\nexperience and the evidence, the committee agreed that it should remain as the first\nchoice, with rectal diazepam as an alternative if agreed, based on previous use or if buccal\nmidazolam is unavailable.\nThe committee agreed that the evidence for further antiseizure medication, if seizures\ncontinue after 2 doses of a benzodiazepine, showed a benefit for the intravenous\nadministration of levetiracetam, phenytoin or valproate, but did not favour 1 specific\nmedication over the others. However, based on their experience, the committee agreed\nthat levetiracetam can be quicker to prepare, easier to administer and may be associated\nwith fewer adverse effects than the alternative options, so it is likely to become the\npreferred second-line treatment. However, because the evidence showed no difference in\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

If\nstatus epilepticus does not respond to 1 of these medications, the committee agreed that\nanother second-line medication should be considered. In January 2025, the guideline was\nupdated to highlight safety measures and precautionary advice related to updated MHRA\nregulations on the use of sodium valproate (which also applies to sodium valproate used\nintravenously).\nA small amount of evidence showed benefit for general anaesthesia and phenobarbital if\nstatus epilepticus continues after second-line treatment. The committee agreed that these\nshould be considered as third-line treatment options, but cautioned that guidance should\nbe sought from an expert in administering these drugs.\nThe committee discussed concerns that some causes of status epilepticus may need\nadditional treatment and agreed that awareness of the different circumstances that can\ncause status epilepticus should be promoted. They also highlighted the need to\ndifferentiate non-epileptic attacks from convulsive status epilepticus.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee agreed that the recommendations reflect current practice and are not likely\nto involve a significant change in practice or have a substantial resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\nRepeated or cluster seizures\nRecommendations 7.2.1 to 7.2.4\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee discussed the limited evidence available for repeated or clusters of\nseizures. There was some evidence that benzodiazepines are effective, and the committee\nagreed that they should be an option. Clobazam and midazolam were given as examples,\nreflecting the committee's experience and knowledge of current practice. Rectal diazepam\nis not preferred owing to the route of administration. The committee agreed that further\nresearch using clear, consistent definitions for repeated or cluster seizures are needed and\ndeveloped a recommendation for research on antiseizure medication for repeated or\n© NICE 2025.

The committee noted that the definition of prolonged convulsive seizures used to\ninclude those longer than 5 minutes, because status epilepticus was defined as seizures\nthat persist for 30 minutes. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) proposed a\nnew definition of status epilepticus meaning that all seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes\nconstitute status epilepticus.\nThe committee noted that prolonged convulsive seizures should be managed as an\nemergency. Based on their experience and knowledge, they agreed that benzodiazepines\nshould be a treatment option and that midazolam is often used in current practice.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee agreed that the recommendations reflect current practice and are not likely\nto involve a significant change in practice or have a substantial resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\nKetogenic diet\nRecommendation 8.1.1\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms- Page 135 of\nand-conditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nWhy the committee made the recommendation\nThe committee were unable to ascertain clear benefits for ketogenic diets in either adults\nor children with drug-resistant epilepsy from the evidence available. The committee were\nalso mindful of the potential long-term health drawbacks of ketogenic diets, as well as the\nhigh-cost implication of providing ketogenic diets. However, from their experience and\nknowledge, the committee were also aware that benefits are sometimes seen in clinical\npractice for a small number of people with drug-resistant epilepsy, including children with\ncertain childhood epilepsy syndromes.\nThe committee decided against recommending ketogenic diets routinely, but did not wish\nto remove them completely as an option for specialist consideration in people with few\nfurther treatment options. They highlighted the need for high-quality clinical data in this\narea and agreed that a recommendation for research for children and adults on the\neffectiveness and long-term tolerability of ketogenic diets would help to inform future\nguidance.\nHow the recommendation might affect practice\nKetogenic diets are not routinely offered and so the recommendations are unlikely to have\nan impact on current practice.\nReturn to recommendation\nResective epilepsy surgery\nRecommendations 8.2.1 to 8.2.4\nWhy the committee made the recommendations:\nThe evidence on surgical interventions showed that resective epilepsy surgery is the most\nclinically effective treatment for children, young people and adults with drug-resistant\nfocal epilepsy. This was based on the evidence showing better quality of life and lower\nrates of recurrence after surgery compared with medical care. The committee also\nconsidered the relative harms of surgery, such as higher rates of postoperative cognitive\ndeficits and other adverse events. The benefits of surgery were agreed to outweigh these\nharms, because in many cases, the cognitive effects did not cause significant dysfunction\nin everyday life, and many of the other adverse events (perioperative infection, bleeding\n© NICE 2025.

In addition, the committee noted\nthat the risk of harm from surgery needed to be balanced against the risks of ongoing\nseizures, which include injury, head injury and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy\n(SUDEP). The committee accepted that the risk of harm may increase as the surgical\ncomplexity increases, but agreed that the overall balance in favour of a benefit is likely to\napply across most types of epilepsy surgery for both children and adults.\nOriginal health economic modelling was undertaken to assess the cost effectiveness of\nresective epilepsy surgery in adults. However, insufficient data were available to model\ncost effectiveness in children. The results of the analysis indicated that resective epilepsy\nsurgery was cost effective in adults. Overall, the committee concluded that resective\nepilepsy surgery was also highly likely to be cost effective for children because they\ntypically have better outcomes after surgery than adults, and the benefits of surgery are\nexperienced for longer. The committee did note that the cost of assessment for resective\nepilepsy surgery may be higher in children, but these costs would likely be offset by later\nsavings in the form of fewer outpatient appointments and the benefits observed from\nresective epilepsy surgery.\nNo evidence was found on the most effective criteria for referral. However, the committee\nagreed that because benefits from surgery would outweigh harms across all the\npopulations considered, including improvement in seizure control, potential seizure\nfreedom, better quality of life and reduced risk of epilepsy-related death, all people with\ndrug-resistant epilepsy would benefit from a referral to a tertiary centre for consideration\nof resective surgery, including those without identified MRI abnormalities.\nThe committee also discussed whether there were other groups that might benefit from a\nreferral for consideration of surgery. The committee agreed, by consensus, that people\nwith specific MRI abnormalities that might indicate future resistance to antiseizure\nmedication, should be referred to a tertiary centre at diagnosis, rather than waiting until\ntreatment is unsuccessful.\nIn addition, the committee discussed that, in their experience, people with genetic\nabnormalities or learning disabilities can sometimes be excluded from referral to a tertiary\ncentre for consideration of surgery. This may happen because it is thought that surgery is\nnot suitable for them, or they might be erroneously considered unable to cope with\nsurgical assessment. The committee agreed they should have treatment in the same way\nas other people with epilepsy and be referred if indicated.\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms- Page 137 of\nand-conditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nOnly a proportion of people with drug-resistant epilepsy are referred for resective surgery\ncurrently, because of relatively low levels of epilepsy surgical treatment provision, as well\nas lengthy waiting times for presurgical assessments. Therefore, referral of all people with\ndrug-resistant epilepsy to surgical centres will probably lead to an increase in presurgical\ninvestigations and surgical procedures. This may necessitate the need for more epilepsy\nsurgical training and a greater investment in epilepsy surgery programmes.\nReferral of people whose epilepsy is not drug resistant might increase the burden on\ntertiary centres, but the number of people in these groups is likely to be relatively small.\nReturn to recommendations\nVagus nerve stimulation\nRecommendations 8.3.1 and 8.3.2\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nThere was no long-term robust evidence on vagus nerve stimulation in epilepsy. The\ncommittee noted that there is variation in current use, but that it tends to be offered when\nantiseizure medications have failed to control seizures and epilepsy surgery is not suitable\nor has not been successful. There was no evidence to suggest that use of vagus nerve\nstimulation should stop for this small group with complex needs and few management\noptions. The committee agreed that the benefits and harms should be discussed with the\nperson because the intervention does not work in all people and is not a risk-free\nprocedure. NICE has published interventional procedures guidance on the use of vagus\nnerve stimulation in children with refractory epilepsy. The committee agreed that more\nresearch is needed in this area and drafted a recommendation for research on the\neffectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe use of vagus nerve stimulation in practice is currently quite varied. It tends to be a\npalliative procedure for people with epilepsy that is resistant to treatment and who are not\ncandidates for surgery. The recommendations are not expected to lead to a large change\nin current practice.\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

They also\nacknowledged the gap in communication and knowledge between the different specialities\ninvolved in managing epilepsy and these comorbidities, and thus the need for joint\nmultidisciplinary working relationships. The committee highlighted the importance of\nactive and ongoing liaison between the different specialist teams and people with epilepsy\n(and their families and carers if appropriate) to ensure the adequate support and\ntreatment is in place. The committee agreed the recommendations reflected current good\npractice.\nSupport and treatment\nThere is variability in the evidence in terms of the different types of psychological\ninterventions, the healthcare professionals who delivered the therapies and the\ncharacteristics of people included in the studies. The analyses showed that the\ndifferences in psychological treatments and populations did not affect the epilepsy-related\nquality-of-life outcome significantly, but the committee acknowledged that making\nrecommendations for specific subgroups of people for specific interventions would not be\npossible from the pooled evidence. The committee also agreed that the clinical evidence\nfor children and young people was extremely limited and very uncertain. However, the\ncommittee acknowledged the importance of recognising neurodevelopmental\ncomorbidities in children, particularly those with complex syndromes that may need\nadditional support from the multidisciplinary team.\nCoupled with the lack of health economic evidence, it was not possible to make\nrecommendations for tailored psychological interventions with any confidence.

Anxiety is also\nassociated with epilepsy, along with psychosis to a lesser degree. The increased risk of\ndying from suicide was also noted. The committee highlighted that healthcare\nprofessionals should be alert to these psychological comorbidities and check for them in\npeople with epilepsy as part of regular review. The committee agreed to refer to existing\nNICE guidance on depression. They also agreed to make a recommendation for research\non the cost effectiveness of tailored psychological therapy for people with epilepsy.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations on providing coordinated care do not reflect routine practice, and\ntherefore will involve a change of practice for the majority of providers.\nThe guideline committee acknowledged the lack of psychological therapies available to\npeople with epilepsy in current practice, especially children and young people. Although\nsome centres have access to neuropsychology services, this varies across the country\nand there are often long waiting lists. An improvement in access to psychological services\nfor people with epilepsy and depression or anxiety may result from highlighting existing\nNICE guidance. No significant resource impact is expected as a consequence of the\nrecommendations on support and treatment.\nReturn to recommendations\nReducing the risk of epilepsy-related death\nincluding sudden unexpected death in epilepsy\nRecommendations 10.1.1 to 10.1.5 and 10.2.1 and 10.2.2\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nPrediction tools\nThere was a lack of evidence for tools predicting sudden unexpected death in epilepsy\n(SUDEP) and other causes of epilepsy-related death. Sparse data for the SUDEP-7 and\nSUDEP-7 revised tools suggested good accuracy, but the level of imprecision was very\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms- Page 140 of\nand-conditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nhigh because of the small number of SUDEP events recorded. Similarly, although there\nwas some evidence for 3 tools for predicting all-cause mortality, it was from a single study\nwith insufficient data to make recommendations.\nThe committee agreed that more research is needed and that this should focus on the\ndevelopment of a tool, as well as its validation (see the recommendation for research on\nrisk prediction tool for all-cause epilepsy-related death). The new tool should not focus\nentirely on SUDEP but should look at other causes of epilepsy-related death, such as\nsuicide, injury and drowning. Large national or international registries recording SUDEP, all\ncauses of death and a wide range of risk factors are needed to produce data of sufficient\ndetail to inform a useful tool. These would need to collect data over a long period of time\nto provide useful numbers of outcomes.\nThe committee also acknowledged that the SUDEP-7 tool showed some promise, despite\nthe uncertainties in the data, and agreed that further larger-scale validation studies of\nSUDEP-7 should be conducted in the shorter term.\nRisk factors\nThe committee agreed it was important to highlight the increased risk of premature death,\nincluding SUDEP, for people with epilepsy. The lifetime risk of SUDEP is estimated to be\nbetween 7% and 12%. This risk is increased in people with severe drug-resistant epilepsy,\nand is particularly high among those with uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures. To help\nprevent premature death, people with epilepsy and their families or carers should be\nsupported to understand their individualised risk as well as what they can do to reduce the\nrisk of SUDEP.\nBased on the evidence and their experience in clinical practice, the committee decided to\nhighlight non-adherence to medication, alcohol and drug misuse, living alone, sleeping\nalone without supervision, and generalised tonic-clonic, focal to bilateral tonic-clonic and\nuncontrolled seizures, as important risk factors. Non-adherence to medications may also\ncause the person to experience more seizures and increase their risk of physical injury and\npremature death. The committee acknowledged that the type of seizures the person has\nand how often they have them can be modified through medication, significantly reducing\nthe risk of death from seizures. The evidence showed that living alone or sleeping without\nsupervision increased a person's risk of dying. By modifying these risk factors with\nsupport from family, carers and clinicians, a person can directly reduce their risk of\npremature death or SUDEP. The committee did acknowledge that it may not be possible to\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

They highlighted the use of\nmonitors and alarms to prevent risk in children living with their parents. The committee\nalso acknowledged that it may not be possible to remove all risk related to epilepsy.\nThe evidence demonstrated that several comorbidities could contribute to the risk of\nepilepsy-related death. Therefore, the committee agreed that from a person's clinical\nhistory, a person's individual risk of premature death including SUDEP should be assessed\nand should include a history of abnormal neurological findings, neurological conditions and\ncancer.\nThe committee noted that other risk factors may increase the risk of premature death in a\nperson with epilepsy, and that these should also be discussed with the person to help\nthem fully understand their individual risk.\nInterventions\nThere was a lack of evidence for interventions to reduce seizure-related death including\nSUDEP. The committee agreed that the evidence on supervising people with nocturnal\nseizures was not of sufficient quantity or quality to warrant making a recommendation.\nHowever, based on their clinical experience and expertise, the committee agreed it was\nimportant to discuss risk factors with people who have nocturnal seizures to minimise the\nrisk of seizures and promote safe practice (such as adherence to medication and\nimproving sleep hygiene) as much as possible. Although limited, the evidence for nocturnal\nsupervision did show some benefit, and based on their knowledge and experience, the\ncommittee agreed that this might be discussed alongside other support and information\non minimising risks, for example if a carer wishes to use a night monitor or a parent wishes\nto sleep in the same room as a child.\nThe committee agreed that every effort should be made to reduce epilepsy-related risk,\nparticularly the risk of mortality, and emphasised the importance of supporting people\nwith epilepsy to take their medications as prescribed to reduce seizures. Although this\napplies to all people with epilepsy, the committee noted that this is particularly the case\nfor people with generalised tonic-clonic seizures and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic\nseizures, because these seizure types are associated with higher risk.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe committee highlighted that there is variation in the information currently discussed\n© NICE 2025.

However, because\nthere was economic evidence of cost savings both long term and within the first year, the\ncommittee agreed that people with epilepsy should have access to an epilepsy specialist\nnurse. Epilepsy specialist nurses are already embedded in practice and the committee\nagreed that they play a vital role in supporting other healthcare professionals in primary,\nsecondary and tertiary care, as well as educational and social care settings. They are\nspecialised in supporting children, young people and adults with all aspects of living with\nepilepsy, providing support with information giving, advice on administering medications,\ncare planning, management of side effects and the impact of epilepsy on daily activities. In\naddition, epilepsy specialist nurses may identify problems that had been previously\nunnoticed, such as long-standing side effects of antiseizure medications.\nThe committee used the evidence to determine the common features of clinically and\ncost-effective epilepsy specialist nurse interventions. Based on the clinical evidence, they\nagreed that interventions should include emotional wellbeing and self-management\nstrategies to support improvements to day-to-day living and health. Based on economic\nevidence and their own expertise, the committee agreed that people's needs for\ninformation and care planning may vary over time and more contact may be needed when\n© NICE 2025.

The economic evidence showed that epilepsy specialist nurse-led\ninterventions are likely to be cost saving and cost effective when delivered twice a year to\npeople with epilepsy and after attending an emergency department. The committee\nrecommended this approach for people with ongoing seizures or after an emergency\ndepartment visit. Although it was a wider population (approximately 300,000 people in\nEngland) to that explored in the economic analyses, they are much more likely to be in\nregular contact with healthcare services, with a quarter of this group making at least\n1 emergency department visit per year. Nearly all will have some sort of outpatient\nappointment in a hospital setting, often with an epilepsy specialist nurse where these are\navailable. Therefore, a large number of these epilepsy specialist nurse appointments will\nalready be taking place or will replace appointments with other healthcare practitioners.\nAlthough there will be additional total healthcare appointments as a result of these\nrecommendations, the increase would be much smaller in this group than for all people\nwith epilepsy, and costs would be potentially regained within the first year.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations reflect current practice available in some services, but there is\nvariation in epilepsy specialist nurses' involvement across different settings. Some\nservices may need to make changes to practice, such as hiring epilepsy specialist nurses\nor changing how they work, but this should lead to a number of advantages, including\nimproved patient satisfaction and emotional wellbeing, greater consistency in provision\nand care, improved access to epilepsy specialist nurses and potentially cost savings.\nThe involvement of an epilepsy specialist nurse is likely to result in cost savings by\nreducing the overall use of healthcare services especially in terms of reduced emergency\ndepartment visits and the subsequent length of hospital stay.\nReturn to recommendations\nTransition from children's to adults' epilepsy\nservices\nRecommendations 11.2.1 to 11.2.6\n© NICE 2025.

Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms- Page 144 of\nand-conditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nWhy the committee made the recommendations\nThe committee acknowledged that many of the recommendations in the NICE guideline on\ntransition from children's to adults' services for young people using health or social care\nservices are directly applicable to young people with epilepsy and their families or carers.\nSo, they reviewed the evidence on identified themes specific to people with epilepsy that\nare not covered by that guideline.\nThe committee noted that a young person's transition should be tailored to their needs\nand that this should be recognised by both paediatric and adult services. The committee\ndiscussed the value of reviewing diagnosis and management at transition and agreed that\nthis should involve both paediatric and adult multidisciplinary teams working together with\nthe young person and their family or carers. The evidence found that young people who\nengaged with a multidisciplinary team felt more confident and able to communicate their\nneeds, so the committee stressed that planning and decision making should be patient-\ncentred, with young people and their families and carers (if appropriate) fully involved in\ndiscussions about their transition and ongoing care.\nThe committee acknowledged that transition can be a distressing time for young people\nwith epilepsy and their families and carers. The evidence showed a lack of clarity in\ncommunication and the information given to young people and their families and carers at\ntransition, for example they lacked clear information about the risks of SUDEP and\nunplanned pregnancy. The committee agreed that clear and balanced information is vital\nduring transition and, based on their experience, listed some key areas that should be\ncovered in discussions. In particular, stigma around epilepsy was highlighted as an\nimportant topic to raise so as to give the young person the opportunity to discuss their\nexperiences and for support to be provided. The evidence showed that stigma can have a\nsignificant impact on young people's everyday activities, educational achievement and\nengagement with healthcare professionals. The evidence also suggested that repeating\ninformation at intervals during transition would help young people understand and retain\nkey information. Based on the evidence and their experience, the committee highlighted\nthe importance of providing information in a suitable format for the person, using language\nthey understand and that is appropriate for their developmental age, and avoiding\ntechnical terms.\nThe evidence showed that young people with epilepsy and a learning disability, and their\nparents, often struggled with transition, and had difficulty finding information and\nunderstanding the changes in service provision. They noted that transition was often not\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

Young\npeople with learning disabilities may have complex needs, and transition to adult services\nmay need more planning and involve other specialties, such as a learning disabilities\nmultidisciplinary team and child and adolescent mental health services. Based on their\nexperience, the committee agreed that it would be beneficial to start transition planning\nearlier than usual for young people with complex health or social care needs, including\npeople whose seizures were not fully controlled by their treatment or those with a learning\ndisability, to allow time for care packages to be set up. They agreed that the timeframe\nwould depend on individual circumstances.\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\nThe recommendations reflect current best practice so the committee agreed there should\nbe no resource impact.\nReturn to recommendations\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms- Page 146 of\nand-conditions#notice-of-rights). 150\nEpilepsies in children, young people and adults (NG217)\nContext\nEpilepsy is one of the most common serious neurological disorders, affecting around\n50 million people worldwide and about 533,000 in England and Wales. Of these, around\n112,000 are children and young people. The incidence of epilepsy is estimated to be\n50 per 100,000 per year and the prevalence of active epilepsy in the UK is estimated to be\n5 to 10 people per 1,000. Epilepsy is also a common cause of people attending A&E\ndepartments. Epileptic seizures can result in injury, and may also be associated with\nmortality, for example, because of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).\nCurrent practice\nMost people with active epilepsy (60% to 70%) have their seizures satisfactorily controlled\nwith antiseizure medications. Other treatment options may include surgery, vagus nerve\nstimulation, and psychological and dietary therapies. Optimal management improves\nhealth and wellbeing, including reducing the impact of epilepsy on social activities,\neducation and career choices, and reduces the risk of SUDEP.\nThe original NICE guideline on epilepsy (2004) stated that the annual estimated cost of\nestablished epilepsy was £2 billion (direct and indirect costs). However, newer and more\nexpensive antiseizure medications are now being prescribed. With an increase in treatment\ncosts likely in coming years, it is essential to ensure that antiseizure medications with\nproven clinical and cost effectiveness are identified.\nThe 2004 NICE guideline on epilepsies, the 2004 NICE technology appraisal guidance and\nthe subsequent 2012 pharmacological review on newer drugs for epilepsy, failed to show a\ndifference in effectiveness between newer and older antiseizure medications, or between\nthe newer drugs (as monotherapy) for seizure control. The International League Against\nEpilepsy has proposed new definitions and a framework for classifying epilepsy, and\ndiagnosis and investigation have become more focused on aetiology. This guideline\nupdate reflects this and considers new evidence on managing epilepsies.\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

in the number of epilepsy specialists,\nand improved and faster access to clinics devoted to epilepsy and first seizures. The number of drugs available\nto treat epilepsy has increased and the range of imaging, surgical and interventional techniques has risen.\nCollectively, these changes have helped to bring about the improvements in care highlighted as necessary\nin the previous guideline.\nDespite these improvements, however, the scale and scope of the need for a guideline should not be\nunderestimated. In Scotland there are 54,000 people with active epilepsy affecting all ages,1, 2 and there\nwill be between 2,000 and 3,500 new diagnoses each year.1 The low number of epilepsy specialists in\nprevious decades means that many people with epilepsy across the UK have been diagnosed and treated\nby non-specialists in both primary and secondary care. Up to a quarter of patients referred for specialist\nmanagement of apparent drug-resistant epilepsy do not have epilepsy and around 50% of referrals to first\nseizure clinics result from events which are not epileptic. There is evidence that management can sometimes\nbe suboptimal,3-5 and with some intervention, readily improved.3, 5 Epilepsy carries a small but significant\nrisk of mortality which is increased where seizure control is incomplete. Specific concerns surround initial\ndiagnosis, drug treatment, management of pregnant women with epilepsy and the provision of patient\ninformation. It is likely that the incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) could be reduced\nif antiepileptic treatment was always optimised and patients made aware of the importance of adherence.\nThere is room for improvement in the diagnosis and management of status epilepticus and in the care and\nadvice provided for women of reproductive age. People with epilepsy often report inadequate provision\nof information and advice. Such needs were highlighted in the previous guideline and, over ten years on,\nthere remains scope for the development of better epilepsy services in both primary and secondary care.\n1.1.1 UPDATING THE EVIDENCE\nThis guideline updates SIGN 70: Diagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults to reflect the most recent\nevidence.\nWhere no new evidence was identified to support an update, text and recommendations are reproduced\nverbatim from SIGN 70. The original supporting evidence was not reappraised by the current guideline\ndevelopment group.\n1.1.2 SUMMARY OF UPDATES TO THE GUIDELINE, BY SECTION\nIn September 2018, this guideline was updated to take account of new drug safety advice from the Medicines\nand Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), published in April 2018, relating to use of valproate\nmedicines in women and girls of childbearing potential.454 Warnings have been inserted where relevant in\nsections 4 and 5 to reflect this advice.\n2 Key recommendations New\n3 Diagnosis Updated\n4 Treatment Updated September 2018\n5 Epilepsy and women’s health Updated September 2018\n6 Psychiatric comorbidity New\n7 Sleep New\n8 Mortality New\n9 Models of care Completely revised\n10 Provision of information Completely revised\n11 Implementing the guideline Completely revised\n12 The evidence base Completely revised\n| 1\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n1.2 REMIT OF THE GUIDELINE\n1.2.1 OVERALL OBJECTIVES\nThis guideline provides recommendations based on current evidence for best practice in the diagnosis and\nmanagement of epilepsy in adults. It does not include patients with a non-epileptic attack disorder (see\nsection 3.3.1).\n1.2.2 TARGET USERS OF THE GUIDELINE\nThis guideline will be of interest to all health professionals in primary and secondary care involved in the\nmanagement of people with epilepsy, including general practitioners, practice nurses, epilepsy specialist\nnurses, general physicians, emergency department specialists, neurologists, obstetricians, clinical\nneuropsychologists and psychiatrists. It will also be of interest to those commissioning epilepsy services,\npublic-health physicians, pharmacists, social-work staff, carers and relatives of people with epilepsy and\npeople with epilepsy themselves.\n1.3 STATEMENT OF INTENT\nThis guideline is not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are\ndetermined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual case and are subject to change\nas scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. Adherence to guideline\nrecommendations will not ensure a successful outcome in every case, nor should they be construed as\nincluding all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same\nresults. The ultimate judgement must be made by the appropriate healthcare professional(s) responsible\nfor clinical decisions regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan. This judgement should only\nbe arrived at following discussion of the options with the patient, covering the diagnostic and treatment\nchoices available. It is advised, however, that significant departures from the national guideline or any local\nguidelines derived from it should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant\ndecision is taken.\n1.3.1 PRESCRIBING OF LICENSED MEDICINES OUTWITH THEIR MARKETING AUTHORISATION\nRecommendations within this guideline are based on the best clinical evidence. Some recommendations\nmay be for medicines prescribed outwith the marketing authorisation (MA) also known as product licence.\nThis is known as ‘off-label’ use.\nMedicines may be prescribed off label in the following circumstances:\ny for an indication not specified within the marketing authorisation\ny for administration via a different route\ny for administration of a different dose\ny for a different patient population.\nAn unlicensed medicine is a medicine which does not have MA for medicinal use in humans.\nGenerally off-label prescribing of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed\nmedicines within the marketing authorisation. Such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and\nexperience.6\n“Prescribing medicines outside the conditions of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases)\nthe prescribers’ professional responsibility and potential liability”.6\n2 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 1 • Introduction\nThe General Medical Council recommends that when prescribing a medicine off label, doctors should:\ny be satisfied that such use would better serve the patient’s needs than an authorised alternative (if one\nexists)\ny be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence/experience of using the medicines to show its safety and\nefficacy, seeking the necessary information from appropriate sources\ny record in the patient’s clinical notes the medicine prescribed and, when not following common practice,\nthe reasons for the choice, and\ny take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient’s care, including monitoring\nthe effects of the medicine.\nNon-medical prescribers should ensure that they are familiar with the legislative framework and their own\nprofessional prescribing standards.\nPrior to any prescribing, the licensing status of a medication should be checked in the summary of product\ncharacteristics (www.medicines.org.uk). The prescriber must be competent, operate within the professional\ncode of ethics of their statutory bodies and the prescribing practices of their employers.7\n1.3.2 ADDITIONAL ADVICE TO NHSSCOTLAND FROM HEALTHCARE IMPROVEMENT SCOTLAND AND THE\nSCOTTISH MEDICINES CONSORTIUM\nHealthcare Improvement Scotland processes multiple technology appraisals (MTAs) for NHSScotland that\nhave been produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales.\nThe Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) provides advice to NHS boards and their Area Drug and Therapeutics\nCommittees about the status of all newly licensed medicines and any major new indications for established\nproducts.\nSMC advice relevant to this guideline is summarised in section 11.4.\n| 3\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n2 Key recommendations\nThe following recommendations were highlighted by the guideline development group as the key clinical\nrecommendations that should be prioritised for implementation. The grade of recommendation relates to\nthe strength of the supporting evidence on which the recommendation is based. It does not reflect the\nclinical importance of the recommendation.\n2.1 DIAGNOSIS\nC The diagnosis of epilepsy should be made by an epilepsy specialist.\nC A clear history from the patient and an eyewitness to the attack give the most important diagnostic\ninformation, and should be the mainstay of diagnosis.\n2.2 TREATMENT\nAntiepileptic drugs should be offered after a first tonic-clonic seizure if:\nB y the patient has had previous myoclonic, absence or focal seizures\nB y the EEG shows unequivocal epileptic discharges\nB y the patient has a structural cerebral disorder\nD y the patient considers the risk of recurrence unacceptable.\nC Routine switching between different manufacturers of antiepileptic drugs should be avoided.\nC Failure to respond to appropriate antiepileptic drugs should prompt a review of the diagnois of\nepilepsy and adherence to medication.\nB Referral for assessment for neurosurgical treatment should be considered if the epilepsy is drug\nresistant.\nD EEG should be used for confirming diagnosis of and monitoring treatment effects in patients\nwith status epilepticus. EEG should be available as an emergency intervention for all patients with\ntreated or suspected status epilepticus.\n2.3 MANAGEMENT OF PROLONGED SEIZURES INCLUDING STATUS EPILEPTICUS\n As soon as possible:\ny secure airway\ny give oxygen\ny assess cardiac and respiratory function\ny secure IV access in large veins.\nB Patients with prolonged tonic-clonic seizures that have lasted five minutes or more should be\ngiven:\ny midazolam 10 mg buccally or intranasally, or\ny lorazepam 4 mg IV if midazolam is unavailable, or\ny diazepam 10 mg if midazolam and lorazepam are unavailable.\nB Administer a repeat dose of benzodiazepine in hospital after 10 minutes if there is no response.\n4 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 2 • Key recommendations\n2.4 EPILEPSY AND WOMEN’S HEALTH\nC To minimise the risk of contraceptive failure, a woman using any combined hormonal contraception,\nor a combined oral contraceptive pill, or a progesterone-only pill should be prescribed an\nantiepileptic drug that does not induce hepatic enzymes.\nWomen with epilepsy should:\nB y receive prepregnancy counselling at the time of diagnosis and at regular intervals during their\nmanagement, especially if they are taking antiepileptic drug treatment\nD y be reassured that most will have a normal pregnancy and delivery\nC y have their diagnosis and treatment, if appropriate, reviewed by specialist services before\nconception; a concerted effort should be made to optimise seizure control and rationalise\nantiepileptic drug therapy prior to conception\nD y be well informed about pregnancy and epilepsy-related issues, including smoking cessation,\nbefore conception.\n2.5 PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITY\nD Screening for depression and suicidality should be considered in all patients with epilepsy.\n2.6 MORTALITY\nB Healthcare professionals and patients should aim for complete seizure freedom to reduce the risk\nof sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.\nD Adherence to the prescribed antiepileptic drug regime should be strongly encouraged and the\npatient asked to report any adverse effects that might compromise adherence in order to reduce\nthe risk of increased mortality and morbidity.\n Patients with active seizures, ie who have sustained seizures, and in particular generalised tonic-clonic\nseizures, in the past year, should be assessed by a specialist physician and epilepsy nurse specialist.\nD Counselling about the risks of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy should be considered for\npatients with epilepsy at an appropriate time for the patient and by an appropriate healthcare\nprofessional (consultant neurologist, physician with an interest in epilepsy, specialist registrar, or\nepilepsy nurse specialist).\n2.7 MODELS OF CARE\nD A structured management system for patients with epilepsy should be established in primary\ncare. As with other chronic diseases, an annual review is desirable.\n| 5\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n3 Diagnosis\n3.1 WHO SHOULD MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS OF EPILEPSY?\nThe diagnosis of epilepsy has important physical, psychosocial and economic implications for the patient. It is\ntherefore important that the diagnosis is correct. It has been shown that a significant proportion of epilepsy\n2+\ndiagnoses made by non-specialists are incorrect.3, 4 Epilepsy may be difficult to diagnose in the early stages,8\nespecially in the absence of a witnessed account. Differentiation between epileptic seizures and stereotyped\nbehavioural phenomena can be difficult in people with a learning disability.\nC The diagnosis of epilepsy should be made by an epilepsy specialist.\n The diagnosis of epilepsy is most appropriately delivered in the setting of a dedicated first-seizure or\nepilepsy clinic. Appropriate patient information should be given (see section 10).\nAn epilepsy specialist has been defined as a trained doctor with expertise in epilepsy as demonstrated by\ntraining and continuing education in epilepsy, peer review of practice and regular audit of diagnosis. Epilepsy 4\nmust be a significant part of their clinical workload (equivalent to at least one session a week).9\n3.2 DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION\nIn 2014 the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) task force for the definition of epilepsy proposed\nthat epilepsy be considered a disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions:10\ny at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart\ny one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence\nrisk after two unprovoked seizures (at least 60% over the next 10 years), or\ny diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome.\nThe relevance of this definition to treatment decisions in clinical practice, however, is under discussion. In\npractice many healthcare professionals consider the practical definition of epilepsy, warranting treatment\nwith antiepileptic drugs, as simply the first point of the definition above (ie the occurrence of at least two\nunprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart).\nClassification of seizure types and epilepsy syndromes should always be attempted, as both may have\nimplications for management and prognosis.\nThe ILAE classification systems for seizures and epilepsy syndromes remain the most widely used and\nrecognised systems in clinical practice.11, 12\nAn updated classification and organisational system was proposed by the ILAE in 2010, although this is\nevolving and undergoing refinements.13 It is increasingly used in clinical practice, although has yet to be\nuniversally adopted.\nA brief summary of these classifications systems is given below.\n6 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 3 • Diagnosis\n3.2.1 CLASSIFICATION OF EPILEPTIC SEIZURES (ILAE 1981)\nInternational classification of epileptic seizures:11\nI. Partial seizures\nA. simple partial seizures (no loss of consciousness)\nB. complex partial seizures\n1. with impairment of consciousness at onset\n2. simple partial onset followed by impairment of consciousnes\nC. partial seizures evolving to generalised tonic-clonic (GTC) convulsions\nII. Generalised seizures\n(convulsive or nonconvulsive with bilateral discharges involving subcortical structures)\nA. absence\nB. myoclonic\nC. clonic\nD. tonic\nE. tonic-clonic\nF. atonic\nIII. Unclassified epileptic seizures\n(usually used when an adequate description is not available)\n3.2.2 CLASSIFICATION OF EPILEPSY SYNDROMES (ILAE 1989)\nIn this system,12 the principal divisions are between focal epilepsies, in which seizures arise from a specific\narea of the brain, and generalised epilepsies, in which seizures arise in diffuse bilateral networks.\nFocal and generalised epilepsies are themselves subdivided into idiopathic syndromes, which have a\npresumed genetic basis, and cryptogenic/symptomatic syndromes, in which a structural lesion is known or\nsuspected (although may not always be visible on imaging).\n3.2.3 UPDATED ORGANISATION SYSTEM FOR SEIZURES AND EPILEPSIES (ILAE 2010)\nThe updated classification system recognises that classification is challenging, as there is still insufficient\nknowledge to develop a fundamental framework on which to base a scientific classification. This system is\ndesigned to be an ‘organisation’ system (rather than a scientific classification), with a greater flexibility such\nthat it can be useful both in clinical practice and in scientific research.\nWhen used in clinical practice, however, this system is not dissimilar to the 1989 system, but with some key\nchanges in nomenclature.13\ny The terms ’simple partial seizure’ and ’complex partial seizure’ have been replaced by the term ’focal\nseizure’. Focal seizures in which consciousness is impaired are described as ’focal dyscognitive seizures’.\ny The terms ’idiopathic’, ’symptomatic’ and ’cryptogenic’ have been replaced by the terms ‘genetic’,\n‘structural-metabolic’, and ‘unknown’.\nFor the purposes of this guideline, the nomenclature of the updated (ILAE 2010) classification system has\nbeen used.\n| 7\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n3.2.4 THE RELEVANCE OF CLASSIFICATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE\nIt is important to make the distinction between genetic generalised epilepsies (GGEs, the new term for\nidiopathic generalised epilepsies) and focal epilepsies, as this affects treatment choices, investigation,\nprognosis and counselling. Identifying the aetiology is important in focal epilepsies.\n2+\nThe onset of GGEs is unusual over the age of 25.14 The most common GGEs in adolescence are juvenile 4\nmyoclonic epilepsy (generalised tonic-clonic seizures with myoclonic seizures on waking, sometimes with\nabsence seizures, with photoparoxysmal response in 30% of cases), early morning tonic-clonic seizures in\nadolescence, and juvenile absence epilepsy. These phenotypes may overlap.15-19\nFeatures suggesting genetic generalised epilepsies are:\ny childhood or teenage onset\ny triggered by sleep deprivation and alcohol\ny early morning tonic-clonic seizures or myoclonic jerks\ny short absence seizures\ny photoparoxysmal response on electoencephalography (EEG)\ny generalised 3 per second spike and wave or polyspike and wave on EEG.\nFeatures suggesting focal epilepsies are:\ny history of potential cause\ny aura\ny focal motor activity during seizure\ny automatisms.\nC The seizure type(s) and epilepsy syndrome should be identified.\nC The distinction should be made between a focal epilepsy and a genetic generalised epilepsy.\nTonic-clonic seizures without any focal features or any positive features of a genetic generalised epilepsy\ncannot be confidently classified.\n3.3 CLINICAL FACTORS AND DIAGNOSIS\nAttack disorders such as faint and epilepsy produce their effects because some element of physiology\nbecomes disordered, temporarily disturbing the function of the brain. For a test to positively identify the\nnature of an attack disorder, an attack must be recorded, and the disturbed physiology detected. As this is\nusually impractical, the routine diagnosis of attack disorders is largely clinical, based on history. The history 2+\nshould make clear what occurred before, during and after the attack, from both patient and eyewitness 3\n4\npoints of view. A number of clinical features are common to different types of attack, so diagnosis should\nbe based on the ensemble of the clinical features, not on single features. A generalised tonic-clonic seizure\nmay be the presenting symptom in people with previously unrecognised epilepsy and a detailed history\nshould be taken to uncover previous myoclonic, absence or focal seizures.16, 20-30\nC A clear history from the patient and an eyewitness to the attack give the most important diagnostic\ninformation, and should be the mainstay of diagnosis.\n8 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 3 • Diagnosis\n3.3.1 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF EPILEPSY\nMisdiagnosis of epilepsy is common, and can have major consequences. A full discussion of the differential\ndiagnosis of epilepsy is beyond the scope of this guideline, but the conditions most frequently confused\nwith epilepsy include:\nVasovagal syncope\nThis is the most common attack disorder presenting to hospital emergency departments,31 and may be\nconfused with seizures particularly if there is stiffening and jerking during the episode (convulsive syncope).\nFeatures such as a prior history of fainting, a postural trigger, a warning of lightheadedness and/or visual\nsymptoms, a brief duration of irregular jerking (less than one minute), and a rapid recovery without postictal\nconfusion should raise suspician of convulsive syncope.\nCardiac syncope\nThis is an uncommon but important cause of confusion with epilepsy; this diagnosis should not be missed\ndue to the risk of sudden death from cardiac arrhythmia. Collapse with syncopal features but without warning,\nparticularly if occurring on exercise, or in the context of a personal or family history of either congenital heart\ndisease or sudden death, should raise suspicion of cardiac syncope.\nNon-epileptic attack disorder\nThese are events (also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, dissociative seizures or pseudoseizures)\nwhich clinically resemble or may be mistaken for epileptic seizures, but which are not accompanied by\nelectrophysiological correlates, and which have a presumed or known psychological cause. There is no\nconsensus as to the most appropriate name for such events, and for the purposes of this guideline the terms\n‘non-epileptic attacks’ and ‘non-epileptic attack disorder’ are used. Features which should raise suspicion\nof non-epileptic attack disorder include prolonged duration (over five minutes), an episode of prolonged\nmotionless collapse, rapid recovery, and treatment resistance to multiple antiepileptic drugs with normal\ninvestigations. Definitive diagnosis of non-epileptic attack disorder is often difficult, however, and for effective\nmanagement objective proof (by recording episodes on video-EEG) may be helpful.\nThe list of conditions that may mimic seizures is long, and also includes migraine, parasomnias, movement\ndisorders, metabolic disturbances, and panic disorder; consideration of these conditions, and their distinction\nfrom epilepsy, is beyond the scope of this guideline.\n3.4 USE OF EEG IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF EPILEPSY\n3.4.1 INTERICTAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY\nElectroencephalography is often helpful in the diagnosis and classification of epilepsy.16, 32 However, it is\nessential to understand the scope and limitations of the technique when requesting an EEG examination and\nsubsequently evaluating an expert report on the recording.3 Non-specific EEG abnormalities are relatively\ncommon, especially in older people, patients with migraine or psychotic illness and those taking psychotropic\nmedication. Non-specific abnormalities should not be interpreted as supporting a diagnosis of epilepsy.\n2+\nA normal EEG does not exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy. A single routine EEG recording will show definite\nepileptiform abnormalities in 29–38% of adults who have epilepsy. With repeat recordings this rises to\n69–77%.16, 33-36 The sensitivity is improved by carrying out an EEG soon after a seizure, and by recordings\nduring sleep or following sleep deprivation.16, 37, 38\nIncidental epileptiform abnormalities are found in 0.5% of healthy young adults, but are more likely in people\nwith learning disability and psychiatric disorders, patients with previous neurological insult (for example\nhead injury, meningitis, stroke, cerebral palsy), and patients who have undergone neurosurgery.39-41\n| 9\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nIn a patient in whom the clinical history suggests an epileptic seizure but is not conclusive, the likelihood of\nepilepsy will be high. The finding of epileptiform abnormalities is specific, and the diagnostic value of the\ntest is good. In a patient in whom the history is typical of some other disorder, such as syncope, the likelihood\nof epilepsy will be low, and any epileptiform abnormalities are more likely to be incidental. The test should\nnot be performed in this circumstance.\nEEG can aid classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsy syndromes. The finding or not of a photoparoxysmal 2+\nresponse can allow appropriate advice to be given.42 If carried out within the first few weeks after a first seizure,\nEEG has prognostic value; patients with epileptiform abnormalities are more likely to have a second attack.43\nEEG is the gold standard investigation in the diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus (see section\n4.10.4).\n3.4.2 SHORT-TERM VIDEO-EEG\nInpatient videotelemetry remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of seizure disorders, but short-term\noutpatient EEG may enable definitive diagnosis of non-epileptic attack disorder without recourse to this if a\ntypical attack can be recorded. Studies of short-term video-EEG report that a definitive diagnosis is obtained 1-\nin 33–66% of individuals with non-epileptic attack disorder using this technique.44, 45 The use of induction 3\ntechniques, particularly suggestion, appears to increase the sensitivity of the investigation,44, 46 but this has\nnot been definitively established.\n3.4.3 LONG-TERM EEG MONITORING\nWhen clinical information and standard investigations do not allow a confident diagnosis, referral for the\nrecording of attacks should be considered. The attacks should usually be occurring at least once a week.\nIf non-epileptic attack disorder is a possibility, then monitoring patients with less frequent attacks may be\n2+\nworthwhile, as attacks are often easily provoked.47-54 The best method is inpatient video-EEG recording.55\n3\nTwenty-four hour ambulatory EEG recording has the advantage of recording attacks in the patient’s usual\n4\nsetting, but does not usually allow correlation of EEG and video data.\nThese investigations should include single channel electrocardiography recording.56\n3.4.4 POLYSOMNOGRAPHY\nPolysomnography (PSG) may be used to confirm a diagnosis of sleep-related epilepsy, although the\nsensitivity and specificity of this investigation have not been adequately assessed, and there is evidence\nthat epileptic seizures are less reliably identified on standard PSG-EEG montages than on full video-EEG\n2+\ntelemetry montages.57, 58 Combined PSG with full video-EEG telemetry (video-EEG-PSG) may be helpful in\n3\nthe differential diagnosis of non-epileptic sleep disorders from nocturnal epilepsy,59 but standard PSG, which\nis generally only undertaken for a single night compared to 96 hours for video-EEG telemetry, is likely to be\ninferior to videotelemetry in the diagnosis of epilepsy.\nC EEG is not routinely indicated and cannot exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy.\nC EEG should be used to support the classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsy syndromes\nwhen there is clinical doubt.\nC EEG should be performed in young people with generalised seizures to aid classification and to\ndetect a photoparoxysmal response.\nB Short-term video-EEG, preferably with suggestion, should be available for the investigation and\ndiagnosis of suspected epilepsy and non-epileptic attack disorder.\nC Inpatient video-EEG monitoring and other specialist investigations (including polysomnography\nwith full EEG montages) should be available for patients who present diagnostic difficulties.\n10 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 3 • Diagnosis\n Access to urgent EEG (within 24 hours of request) should be available in all acute medical units for\nthe diagnosis of suspected non-convulsive status epilepticus.\n3.5 HAND-HELD VIDEO\nThere is good evidence that epileptic seizures can be distinguished from non-epileptic attack disorder based\non the semiology alone (ie analysis of the behaviours observed during a seizure).60 Onset of attacks is rarely\n1++\nrecorded, however,55, 61 and the sensitivity and effectiveness of hand-held video (for example smartphones)\nalone as a diagnostic test has not been assessed. Informed consent should always be obtained from the\npatient prior to asking others to videorecord the attacks.\n Asking family members or friends to videorecord events should be considered in patients with\nuncertain diagnosis. Consent should always be sought in advance.\n3.6 BRAIN IMAGING\nBrain imaging detects lesions in 21–37% of patients presenting with epilepsy. Such lesions require treatment\nin only a small minority, but their detection may have implications for future management should the epilepsy\n2+\nbecome intractable. Genetic generalised epilepsies are not associated with an increased prevalence of brain\nlesions.16, 62-65\n3.6.1 MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current standard of reference in the investigation of patients with\nepilepsy. Routine MRI of the brain using simple standard sequences will detect lesions (for example small 2++\ntumours, vascular malformations and cortical dysplasia) that are not detected by computed tomography (CT). 2+\n4\nMRI carried out for the assessment of drug-resistant epilepsy requires specialised protocols and expertise\n(for example to detect hippocampal sclerosis) and should, ideally, be carried out by a neuroradiologist.65-73\n3.6.2 COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY\nCT scanning has a role in the urgent assessment of seizures, or when MRI is contraindicated (for example when\n2++\npatients have pacemakers or metallic implants). A non-contrast CT scan will fail to identify some vascular\n2+\nlesions and tumours. CT has only a limited role in the assessment of intractable epilepsy.66, 73, 74\nC MRI is the modality of choice for brain imaging in patients with epilepsy.\nC Brain imaging is not routinely required when there is a confident diagnosis of a genetic generalised\nepilepsy.\nD CT has a role in the urgent assessment of seizures, or when MRI is contraindicated.\n3.7 ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY\nElectrocardiography (ECG) should be carried out in the assessment of all patients with altered consciousness,\nparticularly those in older age groups, when disorders of cardiac rhythm may simulate epilepsy. Twenty-\n3\nfour hour ambulatory ECG and other cardiovascular tests (including implantable loop devices) may also be\nhelpful.56\n Patients who have blackouts, strange feelings, or ’funny turns‘ should have a 12-lead electrocardiogram.\n| 11\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n3.8 GENETIC TESTING\nThe genetics of epilepsy is a large, and rapidly expanding field. While most genetically acquired epilepsies\nshow a complex inheritance pattern (suggesting involvement of multiple genes and possibly environmental\ninfluences), an increasing number of monogenic epilepsy syndromes (ie epilepsy caused by a mutation in\na single gene) are recognised.75\nWhen assessing a patient with epilepsy a comprehensive history with particular focus on the family history\nshould be taken, and an accurate epilepsy syndromic diagnosis made. While in most cases reassurance can\nbe given that the risk of epilepsy developing in the children of parents with epilepsy is low (see section 5.3),\nexpert advice on the genetics of epilepsy should be available if required.\n A clinical genetics service, with expertise in the genetics of epilepsy, should be available to patients\nwith a very strong family history of epilepsy, or with a clinical phenotype suggestive of a monogenic\nepilepsy syndrome.\n12 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 4 • Treatment\n4 Treatment\n4.1 WHEN TO START ANTIEPILEPTIC TREATMENT\nThe crucial decision whether or not to start antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment must take into account the\nrelative risks of recurrent seizures (including the small but important risk of SUDEP) and the commitment\nto long-term medication with potential adverse effects.\n4.1.1 EPILEPSY\nAntiepileptic drugs should not be given until the diagnosis of epilepsy has been confirmed (see section 3).\nIf there is uncertainty, a period of observation will usually clarify the epilepsy syndrome and confirm the\nneed for treatment.8, 9\n4.1.2 SINGLE SEIZURES\nThe patient’s view on medication should be considered. Women planning a pregnancy may choose to avoid\nAEDs in the short term, though they must be warned of the attendant risks (see section 5.2). Individuals wishing\nto avoid recurrent seizures, for example for driving, should be offered immediate treatment.\nA detailed history should be taken to exclude previous myoclonic, absence or focal seizures as patients with\nundiagnosed epilepsy may present with a single generalised tonic-clonic seizure.16\nWhether to treat a single seizure or not is largely decided by the risk of further seizures. Estimates of\nrecurrence risk vary. Highest recurrence rates (up to 90%) are seen in patients with epileptic discharges on\n1+\nEEG or structural cerebral disorder. Lowest rates (13–40%) are associated with acute symptomatic seizures\n2++\n(provoked) or patients with a normal EEG and no identifiable cause for seizures.43, 76-78 Overall the risk is 2+\n30–40%; this is greatest in the first twelve months and falls to <10% after two years.79 4\nWhile treatment with AEDs after a single seizure has a short-term effect in reducing the recurrence risk,80 this\neffect is not sustained.81, 82 Early treatment with AEDs does not appear to alter the prognosis of epilepsy which\nis best predicted by the number of seizures in the first six months after diagnosis and response to first AED.83-85\nB The decision to start antiepileptic drugs should be made by the patient and an epilepsy specialist.\nAntiepileptic drugs should be offered after a first tonic-clonic seizure if:\nB y the patient has had previous myoclonic, absence or focal seizures\nB y the EEG shows unequivocal epileptic discharges\nB y the patient has a structural cerebral disorder\nD y the patient considers the risk of recurrence unacceptable.\n4.2 ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG MONOTHERAPY\nThe clinical classification of epilepsy along with the adverse effect and interaction profiles for an individual\npatient are key in determining initial monotherapy.86, 87 The dose of each medication should be titrated slowly\nto the maximally tolerated dose or the maximum level as recommended in the British National Formulary.6\nEffect may be monitored by patient-recorded seizure frequency.\nUse of sodium valproate must take into account MHRA safety advice, issued in April 2018, on use of valproate\nmedicines in women and girls of childbearing potential and the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention\nProgramme (see section 5.2.0).454\n| 13\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n4.2.1 FOCAL EPILEPSY\nIn focal epilepsy lamotrigine is as effective and better tolerated than carbamazepine, topiramate, or\noxcarbazepine.86, 88 There is evidence from clinical trials for use of zonisamide and levetiracetam as\nmonotherapy.89, 90 Zonisamide is not approved by SMC for monotherapy for the treatment of focal seizures\n1++\nin adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy (see section 11.4). Lamotrigine may have advantages for adolescents,\nyoung women (see section 5) and older people (see section 4.14) because it is well tolerated,91-93 has a favourable\ncognitive and behavioural profile,94 and does not lead to weight gain.95 Controlled release formulations of\ncarbamazepine may reduce the incidence of adverse effects.96\n4.2.2 GENETIC GENERALISED EPILEPSIES\nIn genetic generalised epilepsies, sodium valproate, topiramate and lamotrigine may be used.87, 97 Of the\nthree, sodium valproate is most effective.87, 97 There is no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence that\nlevetiracetam as monotherapy is superior to established first choice monotherapy with valproate but in some\n1+\ncases it may be a useful first choice, for example in women of reproductive age because of concerns about\nteratogenicity with some AEDs (see section 5.6.3). Levetiracetam is not, however, currently licensed for use\nas monotherapy in generalised epilepsy. Ethosuximide has been used for absence seizures in children for\nmany decades98 and has been shown to have comparable efficacy to sodium valproate in this epilepsy type.99\nUse of sodium valproate must take into account MHRA safety advice, issued in April 2018, on use of valproate\nmedicines in women and girls of childbearing potential and the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention\nProgramme (see section 5.2.0).454\n4.2.3 CHOICE OF FORUMLATION\nStable dosing with individual formulations (generic or branded) is less likely to be associated with worsening\ncontrol than changing formulations of individual drugs.100 Some studies suggest that changing between\n2+\nformulations may lead to variations in seizure control and increased utilisation of health resources.100\nFormulations of AEDs are not interchangeable and generic substitution should not be routinely made.100, 101\nA In patients with focal onset seizures, lamotrigine is the drug of choice. Where lamotrigine is poorly\ntolerated, carbamazepine and levetiracetam may be reasonable alternatives.\nA D In genetic generalised epilepsy or unclassified epilepsy, sodium valproate is the most effective\nantiepileptic drug.\nA y Where sodium valproate is poorly tolerated or contraindicated, lamotrigine and topiramate\nare suitable alternatives.\nD y In women of childbearing age, levetiracetam or lamotrigine may be a reasonable alternative.\nC Routine switching between different manufacturers of antiepileptic drugs should be avoided.\n The adverse effect and interaction profiles should direct the choice of drug for the individual patient.\n Sodium valproate should not be used in women and girls of childbearing potential unless there is no\nsuitable alternative and a Pregnancy Prevention Programme is in place.\n4.3 MANAGEMENT OF DRUG-RESISTANT EPILEPSY\nDrug-resistant epilepsy has been defined as failure to achieve sustained seizure freedom after trials of two\ntolerated and appropriate AED schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination).102\nThe majority of patients with newly-diagnosed epilepsy respond well to AEDs. Failure to do so may be due to:\ny an incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy3, 103\ny an inappropriate choice of AED for the epilepsy syndrome103, 104 1++\n2+\ny failure to take the prescribed AED\n4\ny an underlying cerebral neoplasm, metabolic condition, or immune process\n14 | y concurrent drug or alcohol misuse.\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 4 • Treatment\nGiven a correct diagnosis of epilepsy, failure to control seizures completely with the first well-tolerated AED is\na predictor of drug-resistant epilepsy.85, 105 The choice of adjunctive AED will depend on a number of factors\n2+\nincluding sex, reproductive potential, age, concomitant medications, pre-existing or comorbid conditions,\nother medical or psychiatric conditions and adverse effect profiles.\n2++\nOnce two AEDs have failed as monotherapy the chance of seizure freedom with further monotherapy is\n2+\nlow.85 Improvement in seizure control may be obtained by combining AEDs.106, 107 4\nOnce the decision has been made to use combination therapy, the patient should be established on the best\ncombination at the optimal dose, ie one that produces best efficacy with fewest adverse effects.108 A range of\ndifferent AEDs appropriate to the epilepsy syndrome should be added as necessary in sequence, increasing 2+\nthe dose of each slowly to obtain the best response. Deciding on the best combination may be a matter of 4\ntrial and error, although some evidence exists for enhanced efficacy of lamotrigine/sodium valproate109 and\nlacosamide/non-sodium channel blocking drug.110\nUse of sodium valproate must take into account MHRA safety advice, issued in April 2018, on use of valproate\nmedicines in women and girls of childbearing potential and the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention\nProgramme (see section 5.2.0).454\nThe aim should be seizure freedom on the lowest number of drugs. With good response, consideration should\nbe given to withdrawal of the baseline AED. Where an encouraging but suboptimal effect is obtained with a\nparticular combination, it may be worthwhile trying the addition of a small dose of a third AED.\nThe law of diminishing returns may require patient and doctor to accept the persistence of some seizures\nonce a range of treatment options has failed and where surgery is not an option (see section 4.9). Adequacy\nof seizure control must be balanced with optimal quality of life. Little will be lost by carefully reducing the\ndrug burden in a patient with continuing seizure activity aiming for the most effective combination of two\nor at most three AEDs. Producing less intrusive episodes, abolishing tonic-clonic seizures, preventing falls\nand decreasing automatisms can be acceptable end points for some patients.\n4.3.1 DRUG-RESISTANT FOCAL EPILEPSY\nMeta-analysis has shown that carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine,\nlevetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, perampanel, pregabalin, topiramate and zonisamide are all effective in the\n1++\nadjunctive treatment of focal epilepsy.111, 112 Evidence for treatment with clobazam was limited with one\n1+\nsystematic review reporting that it may reduce seizure frequency.113 The ultimate choice will depend on\nindividual patient factors as described in section 4.3.\nTolerability issues may limit use of retigabine and tiagabine, with retigabine requiring careful monitoring\nto assess for skin and retinal changes.114 While barbiturates can be cost-effective AEDs, their propensity for\n4\ndrug interactions, poor tolerance, and withdrawal seizures mean these should only be used in a specialist\nepilepsy clinic.115\nPatients being treated with vigabatrin should have specific and careful monitoring by opthalmologists\nbecause of the risk of developing concentric visual field defects.108\nDrug-resistant focal epilepsy associated with some primary conditions (for example intracranial tumours or\nparaneoplastic limbic encephalitis) may require multidisciplinary management, for example with oncology\nand neurology.\n4.3.2 DRUG-RESISTANT GENERALISED OR UNCLASSIFIED EPILEPSY\nRCTs have shown that lamotrigine,97 levetiracetam,97, 111 sodium valproate and topiramate87 are all effective\nin the adjunctive treatment of generalised epilepsy. Ethosuximide remains useful in patients with absence 1++\nseizures. Drop attacks in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may respond to rufinamide.116\nLamotrigine acts synergistically with sodium valproate to produce a better therapeutic outcome.109\nLacosamide was shown to be effective and well tolerated. Treatment response was good regardless of type\n2+\nof concomitant AED but when lacosamide was used in combination with a non-sodium channel blocker\nresponse rates were higher and adverse events less frequent.110\n| 15\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nUse of sodium valproate must take into account MHRA safety advice, issued in April 2018, on use of valproate\nmedicines in women and girls of childbearing potential and the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention\nProgramme (see section 5.2.0).454\nC Failure to respond to appropriate antiepileptic drugs should prompt a review of the diagnosis of\nepilepsy and adherence to medication.\nD Combination therapy should be considered when treatment with two first-line antiepileptic drugs\nhas failed or when improved control occurs during the process of phased substitution.\nA Carbamazepine, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, perampanel,\npregabalin, topiramate, sodium valproate and zonisamide may be used in the adjunctive treatment\nof focal epilepsy.\nA Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, ethosuximide, sodium valproate and topiramate may be used in the\nadjunctive treatment of generalised epilepsy.\nB The choice of drugs in combination should be matched to the patient’s seizure type(s) and should,\nwhere possible, be limited to two or at most three antiepileptic drugs.\n Sodium valproate should not be used in women and girls of childbearing potential unless there is no\nsuitable alternative and a Pregnancy Prevention Programme is in place.\n4.4 ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG BLOOD LEVELS\nThere is no indication for routine monitoring of AED concentrations.117-119 Evidence supports clinically useful\ndose-response and dose-toxicity relationships for carbamazepine and phenytoin. These relationships do not\noccur with sodium valproate or any of the newer AEDs. Phenytoin also undergoes saturation kinetics which 1+\n4\ncan make accurate dosage adjustment without concentration monitoring problematical. Even with these\ntwo drugs, however, the upper and lower borders of the target ranges are imprecise and are not applicable\nto all patients.117\nBlood level monitoring should be undertaken to answer a specific clinical question; does imperfect adherence\nto the treatment schedule explain the poor seizure control? Specialist knowledge is required to interpret\nassay results as the pharmacokinetics of some AEDs are non-linear and because of the pharmacokinetic\ninteractions that may take place. This is particularly important given the lack of a useful target range for the\nmajority of AEDs.120\nIn situations where drug metabolism is likely to change, measurement of AED blood levels may be useful,\nfor example in pregnancy (see section 5.4.2).\nD Routine monitoring of antiepileptic drug concentrations is not indicated. Measurement can\nsometimes be useful in the following circumstances:\ny adjustment of phenytoin dose\ny assessment of adherence\ny assessment of toxicity\ny situations where drug metabolism is likely to change, eg pregnancy\ny otherwise unexplained loss of seizure control.\n Antiepileptic drug blood level measurement is best supervised by an epilepsy specialist.\n16 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 4 • Treatment\n4.5 MANAGEMENT OF PROVOKED SEIZURES\nSeizures can be provoked by acute metabolic disturbances, treatment with certain drugs (see section 4.12) and\ndrug withdrawal (for example alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates). Provoked seizures may occur in the\ncontext of drug misuse (alcohol, heroin, cocaine, methadone, amphetamine, ecstasy). The risk of recurrence\nof such provoked seizures can be reduced by correction or withdrawal of the provocative factor.\nA systematic review reported the benefit from benzodiazepines compared to placebo in preventing seizures\nrelated to alcohol withdrawal, although this finding was based on only three studies (two of them very small),\nand a very small number of events. A trend in favour of benzodiazepines compared with other treatments\nfor seizure control in this context was also shown.121 Commencement of longer-term AED treatment is only\nindicated if unprovoked seizures occur.\nProvoked seizures are defined as occurring within seven days of an acute condition such as encephalitis, head 1+\ninjury, cerebral infarction, craniotomy and cerebral haemorrhage. There is evidence that treatment can reduce\nthe risk of such provoked seizures in the context of traumatic brain injury (by phenytoin and carbamazepine),\ncraniotomy (by phenytoin) and cerebral malaria (by phenobarbital).122, 123 There is no evidence, however,\nthat prophylactic treatment of provoked seizures influences the subsequent development of epilepsy. In\npatients with acute traumatic brain injury, there is no evidence that early prophylaxis with AEDs influences\nother outcomes such as death and neurological disability.123 If AED treatment is commenced following the\noccurrence of provoked seizures, it should be used only in the short term, unless unprovoked seizures occur\nlater.\nAttacks occurring immediately after a concussive closed-head injury have been described as concussive\n3\nconvulsions. There is no evidence that these will recur and AED treatment is not indicated.124\n When seizures are provoked by metabolic disturbances or drugs, attention should be directed to\ncorrection or withdrawal of the provocative factor.\n Patients with seizures provoked by alcohol or substance misuse may benefit from referral to addiction\nservices and other support agencies\nB Following an acute brain insult or neurosurgery, long-term prophylactic antiepileptic drug\ntreatment is not indicated.\nC Following an acute brain insult, antiepileptic drugs used to treat the provoked seizures should be\nwithdrawn (unless unprovoked seizures occur later).\nD Antiepileptic drug treatment is not indicated for concussive convulsions.\n4.6 ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG ADVERSE EFFECTS\nAntiepileptic drug adverse effects are common and a major cause of drug failure. Most are mild but a minority\ncan be life threatening.125-127 Accurate data on prevalence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with long-term 1++\nAED treatment is scarce; almost all reports refer to short-term clinical trials and, as experience with vigabatrin 1+\n3\nand visual-field defects has shown, long-term surveillance is needed to identify all ADRs.128 Older people are\nmore sensitive to AED adverse effects (see section 4.14).\n4.6.1 DOSE-RELATED ADVERSE REACTIONS\nMany AED adverse effects are dose-related and predictable. These can be minimised by gradual escalation\nof dose, with dose reduction if symptoms persist. Use of slow-release carbamazepine can reduce peak dose-\nrelated adverse effects of dizziness and blurred vision.129\n| 17\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n4.6.2 IDIOSYNCRATIC ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS\nIdiosyncratic drug reactions usually occur in the first weeks of treatment and are potentially serious. Rash is\nthe most common, occurring in up to 10% of patients on carbamazepine, phenytoin or lamotrigine. Most\nrashes are mild and resolve promptly on discontinuation of the AED, but severe cutaneous reactions are seen\n2+\nin up to 1 in 1,000 patients.130-132 This incidence is increased if the initial dose is increased rapidly.133 Genetic 4\ntesting can help predict idiosyncratic drug reactions in some racial populations, for example carbamazepine\nreaction in Han Chinese and Caucasians.134, 135 Patients of Asian descent should have human leucocyte antigen\n(HLA) status checked prior to starting carbamazepine.\nThe life-threatening AED hypersensitivity syndrome of fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and multiorgan failure\noccurs in up to 4.5 in 10,000 patients, mostly with carbamazepine, lamotrigine or phenytoin.130 It is important 2+\nto note that cross sensitivity occurs between these AEDs in up to 70% of patients. Rapid titration or drug\ninteractions may make this more likely.\nMinor blood dyscrasias are associated with many AEDs; the majority (mild leucopenia with carbamazepine,\n2+\nthrombocytopenia with sodium valproate) require no action. Severe blood dyscrasia occurs in 6 in 10,000\n4\npatients but there is no evidence to suggest that routine monitoring is worthwhile.136, 137\nHyponatraemia (sodium <135 mmol/l) is seen in about 20% of patients taking carbamazepine or\noxcarbazepine; it is usually well tolerated and of no significance.138 If mild (>120 mmol/l) and asymptomatic\nthis should not deter ongoing treatment with AEDs. It should be remembered that other drugs may have\na role in reducing sodium levels and may be targets for reduction if sodium levels become troublesome.\n4\nElevation of liver enzymes (γ-glutamyl transferase 90%, alkaline phosphatase 30%) is seen in people taking\nenzyme-inducing AEDs and is usually of no clinical significance.139 Clinical symptoms have been shown to\nbe more useful than routine monitoring of liver function in identifying the onset of serious ADRs.137, 140\nAcute psychotic reactions are seen occasionally with vigabatrin, topiramate and tiagabine, particularly in those\npatients with a previous history of psychiatric disease; withdrawal from the drug usually results in recovery.141\n4.6.3 CHRONIC SYSTEMIC ADVERSE EFFECTS\nSome AEDs are associated with weight gain and some with weight loss. The effects of different AEDs on\nbodyweight may be influenced by factors such as treatment regimen (for example dosage, mono- or\npolytherapy) and other medications being taken by the patient. The possibility of weight gain or loss should\nbe considered when agreeing treatment plans with patients.\nSedation and dizziness are common complaints of patients starting AED therapy but usually resolve with\ntime.126 Sedation may be less with AEDs licensed from, for example, 1990 onwards, particularly lamotrigine,\n1++\noxcarbazepine and levetiracetam.94 Many patients on long term AED therapy report cognitive adverse effects 2+\n(see section 4.6.5) but studies to confirm this have been contradictory and confounded by the effects of chronic 4\nepilepsy.142, 143 Polytherapy is probably associated with more cognitive adverse effects than monotherapy.144\nImpaired bone health is associated with chronic epilepsy and its treatment, and this should be included in\nthe counselling given near the time of diagnosis (see section 4.6.4).\n Antiepileptic drugs should be commenced in a dose no higher than recommended by the\nmanufacturer.\nC Patients should be warned of common potential adverse effects and given clear instructions to seek\nmedical attention urgently for symptoms including rash, bruising or somnolence with vomiting\nespecially in the first weeks of treatment.\nD Liver function and full blood count should not be monitored routinely.\n18 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 4 • Treatment\n4.6.4 BONE HEALTH\nAntiepileptic drug use is associated with a higher risk of clinical fracture,145-149 with one systematic review\nreporting that AEDs increased the odds of fracture by 1.2 to 2.4 times.148 The evidence is strongest for an\nassociation with phenobarbital, carbamazepine, clonazepam and sodium valproate.148, 149 Bone mineral density 2+\nis also lower in these patients and many fractures are related to seizures.148, 149 Postmenopausal women who 2-\nuse AEDs are at increased risk of fracture (hazard ratio (HR) 1.44, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.61)145 and most AEDs were\nassociated with an increased risk of non-traumatic factures in individuals aged 50 or over.146\nA systematic review found no RCTs investigating therapeutic agents to prevent fracture in people with\nepilepsy although one RCT included in the review suggested that supplementation with high dose vitamin\nD may be associated with increased bone mineral density in patients taking AEDs.148 2+\nA study comparing 150 people taking AEDs and 506 who were not found that fewer than 30% of patients with\nepilepsy know of the association between AEDs and fracture.147 This is a significantly under-researched area.\nC Patients taking antiepileptic drugs should receive dietary and other lifestyle advice to minimise\nthe risk of osteoporosis.\n4.6.5 PSYCHIATRIC AND BEHAVIOURAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS\nA study of the beneficial and adverse psychotropic effects of AEDs in people with epilepsy found that\nlevetiracetam, tiagabine, zonisamide, topiramate and vigabatrin were associated with primarily negative\npsychotropic effects. Psychoses have been reported with levetiracetam, tiagabine, topiramate and vigabatrin\n(see section 6.2.2).150\n1+\nGabapentin, pregabalin and lamotrigine have been associated with positive psychotropic effects, especially\nwith regard to affective symptoms.150\nMethodological problems with some of the reported studies and the risk of confounding, however, mean\nthat these results should be treated with caution.\nB The potential negative psychotropic effects of antiepileptic drugs should be borne in mind when\ndeciding on the most appropriate antiepileptic drug treatment for an individual patient.\n Antiepileptic drug treatment should be used with caution in those with pre-existing behavioural or\npsychiatric conditions and epilepsy.\n4.7 ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG WITHDRAWAL\nEvidence of the risks of seizure recurrence after discontinuation of AEDs was provided by a large, multicentre,\nrandomised, prospective trial of continued antiepileptic treatment versus slow withdrawal in adults and\nchildren with epilepsy who had been seizure free for at least two years.151 AED withdrawal was associated\nwith an increased risk of seizure recurrence, which was influenced by the duration of seizure freedom, the\nhistory of seizure types, the occurrence of one or more seizures after the start of the treatment and whether\none, or more than one, AED was being taken. The data from the study were used to develop a prognostic\n1++\nindex for seizure recurrence.152 This has been used to calculate the risks of seizure recurrence with continued\ntreatment or with slow AED withdrawal (see Tables 1 and 2). An abnormal EEG at the time of entry into the\nstudy was associated with only a small increased risk of seizure recurrence. Since this is unlikely to influence\na decision about whether or not to withdraw AED treatment in adults, EEG recording is not necessary for\nan informed decision to be made. The higher risks of seizure recurrence with a history of myoclonus reflect\nthe high risk of seizure recurrence following AED withdrawal in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The prognostic\nindex has not been validated on an external population, and should be used with caution.\nNo information is available on the risks of seizure recurrence following drug withdrawal in adults who have\nbeen seizure free for less than two years, although for children the risks are higher after less than two years\nof seizure freedom than for more than two years.153\n| 19\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nThe effect of different rates of AED withdrawal on the risk of seizure recurrence has not been adequately\nstudied.\nImportant factors influencing a decision about AED withdrawal in adults include driving, employment, fear of\nfurther seizures, risks of injury or death with further seizures and concerns about prolonged AED treatment.\nThe Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency recommendations should be followed.154\nA Prognostic index indicators can be used to give an estimate of the risks of seizure recurrence\nfollowing antiepileptic drug withdrawal.\n The question of continued treatment or antiepileptic drug withdrawal should be discussed with people\nwith epilepsy who are at least two years seizure free, so that they can make an informed choice. Factors\nto be discussed should include driving, employment, fear and risks of further seizures and concerns\nabout prolonged antiepileptic drug treatment.\n The rate of withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs should be slow, usually over a few months, and longer\nwith barbiturates and benzodiazepines. One drug should be withdrawn at a time.\n4.8 COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY\nComplementary therapy is increasingly popular with patients, who may use this in addition to conventional\nmedication.155, 156 The term covers a wide variety of treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic treatment,\nherbal medicine, homeopathy, osteopathy, yoga, traditional Chinese medicine and cannabinoids. There is\nno consistent evidence to support, or definitively exclude, the use of any particular type of complementary\ntherapy to improve seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy. Findings from systematic reviews covering\n1++\n1+\na range of approaches including meditation techniques,157 acupuncture,158 cognitive behaviour therapy,159\n2++\nyoga,159, 160 and relaxation therapy,159 were inconsistent or not generalisable to a Scottish population (for\nexample for acupuncture) and the quality of the included studies was often poor. Systematic reviews of RCTs\nlooking at the use of traditional Chinese medicine161 and cannabinoids162 found only poor quality studies\nand concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the use of either of these approaches in the\ntreatment of epilepsy.\nPatients should be asked if they are using any complementary medicines and warned about the possibility\nof adverse effects. Problems may arise with the use of some herbal medicines because of interaction\nwith prescribed medication. The potential reduction of the plasma concentrations of carbamazepine,\nphenobarbital and phenytoin should be noted if St John’s wort is used concomitantly.163 The British National 4\nFormulary advises against this. Caution is also advised in the use of evening primrose oil but the evidence\nfor this is less robust.\nSome aromatherapy preparations (for example hyssop, rosemary, sweet fennel, sage and wormwood) may\nhave an alerting effect on the brain and so may exacerbate seizures.164, 165\n20 |\nTable 1: Prognostic index for recurrence of seizures after remission of epilepsy for patients taking only one\nantiepileptic drug152\n| 21\n)%(\nsraey\nowt\nyb\necnerrucer\neruzies\nfo\nksiR\nsraey\n51\nsraey\n01\nsraey\n8\nsraey\n6\nsraey\n4\nsraey\n2\nseruzies\nmorf\neerf\ndoireP\nhtO\nyM\nCT\nhtO\nyM\nCT\nhtO\nyM\nCT\nhtO\nyM\nCT\nhtO\nyM\nCT\nhtO\nyM\nCT\n*yrotsih\neruzieS\n:ypareht\nDEA\nfo\ntrats\nretfa\nseruzieS\n01\n52\n51\n01\n52\n51\n51\n52\n02\n51\n03\n02\n51\n53\n02\n52\n05\n53\nelbaliavanu\nGEE\ntnerruC\n52\n54\n03\n52\n05\n53\n52\n05\n53\n52\n55\n53\n03\n06\n04\n54\n57\n06\n01\n52\n51\n51\n52\n02\n51\n03\n02\n51\n03\n02\n51\n53\n52\n52\n05\n53\nlamronba\nGEE\ntnerruC\n52\n54\n03\n52\n05\n53\n52\n05\n53\n03\n55\n04\n53\n06\n54\n05\n08\n06\n01\n02\n51\n01\n52\n51\n01\n52\n51\n01\n52\n51\n51\n03\n02\n02\n54\n03\nlamron\nGEE\ntnerruC\n02\n04\n52\n02\n54\n03\n02\n54\n03\n52\n54\n03\n03\n55\n53\n04\n07\n55\n:ypareht\nDEA\nfo\ntrats\nretfa\nseruzies\noN\n01\n02\n01\n01\n02\n01\n01\n02\n51\n01\n02\n51\n01\n52\n51\n02\n04\n52\nelbaliavanu\nGEE\ntnerruC\n51\n53\n02\n02\n53\n52\n02\n04\n52\n02\n04\n52\n52\n54\n03\n53\n56\n54\n01\n02\n01\n01\n02\n51\n01\n02\n51\n01\n52\n51\n01\n52\n51\n02\n04\n52\nlamronba\nGEE\ntnerruC\n02\n53\n52\n02\n04\n52\n02\n04\n52\n02\n04\n03\n52\n05\n53\n53\n56\n05\n01\n51\n01\n01\n51\n01\n01\n02\n01\n01\n02\n01\n01\n02\n51\n51\n53\n02\nlamron\nGEE\ntnerruC\n02\n03\n02\n51\n53\n02\n51\n53\n02\n02\n53\n52\n02\n04\n03\n03\n06\n04\nseruzies\ncinolc-cinot\ndesilareneg\nyradnoces\nro\nciteneg\nfo yrotsih\n:CT*\n)enola\nrucco\nylerar\nseruzies\ncinolcoym(\nseruzies\ncinolc-cinot\nhtiw\nseruzies\ncinolcoym\nfo yrotsih\n:yM\ncinolcoym\nro\ncinolc-cinot\nnaht\nrehto\nseruzies\nfo yrotsih\n:htO\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 4 • Treatment\nTable 2: Prognostic index for recurrence of seizures after remission of epilepsy for patients taking more than one\nantiepileptic drug152\n22 |\nOth:\nhistory\nof seizures\nother\nthan\ntonic-clonic\nor\nmyoclonic\nMy:\nhistory\nof myoclonic\nseizures\nwith\ntonic-clonic\nseizures\n(myoclonic\nseizures\nrarely\noccur\nalone)\n*TC:\nhistory\nof genetic\nor\nsecondary\ngeneralised\ntonic-clonic\nseizures\n60\n75\n45\n40\n60\n30\n35\n55\n25\n35\n50\n25\n35\n50\n25\n30\n45\n25\nCurrent\nEEG\nnormal\n35\n50\n25\n20\n35\n15\n25\n30\n15\n20\n25\n15\n15\n25\n10\n15\n25\n10\n65\n85\n55\n50\n65\n35\n40\n60\n30\n40\n55\n30\n40\n55\n30\n35\n55\n25\nCurrent\nEEG\nabnormal\n40\n55\n30\n25\n40\n20\n25\n35\n15\n20\n30\n10\n20\n30\n15\n20\n30\n15\n65\n80\n50\n45\n65\n35\n40\n60\n30\n40\n55\n30\n35\n55\n30\n35\n50\n25\nCurrent\nEEG\nunavailable\n40\n55\n30\n25\n40\n20\n20\n35\n15\n20\n30\n15\n20\n30\n15\n20\n30\n15\nNo\nseizures\nafter\nstart\nof\nAED\ntherapy: 70\n85\n60\n55\n70\n40\n45\n65\n35\n45\n60\n35\n45\n60\n35\n40\n60\n30\nCurrent\nEEG\nnormal\n45\n60\n35\n30\n45\n20\n25\n40\n20\n25\n35\n20\n25\n35\n15\n20\n35\n15\n80\n90\n65\n60\n80\n50\n55\n75\n40\n50\n70\n40\n50\n70\n40\n45\n65\n35\nCurrent\nEEG\nabnormal\n50\n70\n40\n35\n50\n25\n30\n45\n25\n30\n40\n20\n25\n40\n20\n25\n40\n20\n75\n75\n65\n60\n75\n45\n55\n70\n40\n50\n70\n40\n50\n65\n35\n45\n65\n35\nCurrent\nEEG\nunavailable\n50\n65\n40\n35\n50\n25\n30\n45\n20\n25\n40\n20\n25\n40\n20\n25\n35\n20\nSeizures\nafter\nstart\nof\nAED\ntherapy:\nTC\nMy\nOth\nTC\nMy\nOth\nTC\nMy\nOth\nTC\nMy\nOth\nTC\nMy\nOth\nTC\nMy\nOth\nSeizure\nhistory*\nPeriod\nfree\nfrom\nseizures\n2\nyears\n4\nyears\n6\nyears\n8\nyears\n10\nyears\n15\nyears\nRisk\nof\nseizure\nrecurrence\nby\ntwo\nyears\n(%)\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 4 • Treatment\n4.9 SURGICAL REFERRAL\nNeurosurgical procedures are an effective treatment for some patients with epilepsy resistant to drug\ntreatment (see section 4.3).166, 167 It is important that surgery be considered as soon as it is established that\nthe epilepsy is drug resistant, as the benefits will be greater in younger patients. Some neurosurgical\nprocedures involve resection of part of the brain, and the aim is to obtain complete seizure freedom. For\nthe most commonly performed procedures, involving anterior and medial temporal lobe resection, about\n1+\n70% of patients will become seizure free.168 Other procedures are palliative and include callosotomy, subpial\ntransection, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)169 (see section 4.9.1) and direct brain stimulation (see section 4.9.2).\nAssessment for suitability for surgery should be carried out in a specialist unit. For each individual the potential\nbenefits of improved seizure control, quality of life and possible reduction in antiepileptic medication need\nto be balanced against the risks of the surgical procedure.\nB Referral for assessment for neurosurgical treatment should be considered if the epilepsy is drug\nresistant.\nD Assessment as to suitability for a potentially curative resective procedure should be made before\nconsideration of palliative procedures such as vagus nerve stimulation.\n4.9.1 VAGUS NERVE STIMULATION\nEvidence from four systematic reviews suggests that VNS is an effective and relatively safe treatment in patients\nwith medically refractory epilepsy,170-173 although the usefulness of one review may be limited because of\nconcerns about the quality of the included studies.171 One systematic review, however, comparing VNS with\ncontinued or modified AED therapy, failed to find sufficient evidence of superiority of effectiveness or net\nbenefit in medically refractory epilepsy, with complete seizure freedom rarely achieved using VNS and a\n1++\nquarter of patients receiving no benefit from therapy.170 Adverse effects reported in one review were found 2-\nto differ from those for AEDs and included hoarseness, cough, pain, paresthesias and dyspnea, although\nthese appeared to be reasonably well tolerated as dropouts were rare.172 Cost implications of VNS relating to\nimplantation, battery replacement and monitoring of the device and the potential limitation on subsequent\nMRI investigation should be taken into account when VNS is being considered.\nC Vagus nerve stimulation may be considered in adult patients who have been found to be unsuitable\nfor resective surgery\n4.9.2 DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to treat patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who are not\ncandidates for surgery. In one RCT in adults, DBS seemed to reduce seizure frequency, but the trial had\nsubstantial limitations.174\n4.9.3 TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION AND TRIGEMINAL NERVE STIMULATION\nThere is insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation for these modes of non-pharmacological\ntreatment.175\n4.10 MANAGEMENT OF PROLONGED SEIZURES INCLUDING STATUS EPILEPTICUS\nMost seizures remit spontaneously without intervention. If spontaneous cessation does not occur, then\nmanagement should be escalated.\nDefinitions of status epilepticus are varied with minimum durations of either five or 30 minutes.176 Trial protocols\ninvolve intervention being indicated after five minutes of seizure.177 For the purposes of this guideline all\nprolonged seizures are grouped together.\n| 23\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nEmergency treatment should be sought or given once a seizure has persisted, or there are serial seizures,\nfor five minutes or more. Generalised tonic-clonic status epilepticus is a medical emergency with significant\nmorbidity and a mortality of between 16% and 39%.178 Both morbidity and mortality can be exacerbated by\ninadequate or delayed treatment.179-181 Treatment by paramedics after five minutes of tonic-clonic seizure\n1++\nleads to a better outcome than waiting until the patient arrives at the emergency department before 3\nstarting treatment.182-184 Non-convulsive status epilepticus, including focal and absence status epilepticus\nmay be clinically subtle enough to have delayed diagnosis and treatment, but have a much lower risk of\nmorbidity. Prompt and accurate differentiation of status epilepticus from pseudo-status epilepticus and other\nnon-epileptic disorders is crucial if inappropriate treatment and iatrogenic morbidity are to be avoided.179, 185\nAs seizures and sedative drugs can reduce levels of consciousness and because seizure activity does not always\ncause overt clinical movement, EEG recording is the best method of confirming the diagnosis and assessing\n3\ntreatment response when seizures are clinically subtle, for example in non-convulsive status epilepticus (see\nsection 4.10.4) or following treatment of tonic-clonic status epilepticus.186 Non-availability of EEG may lead to\nover-treatment of pseudo-status epilepticus and/or prolongation of sedation and ventilation.\nD EEG should be used for confirming diagnosis of and monitoring treatment effect in patients with\nstatus epilepticus. EEG should be available as an emergency intervention for all patients with\ntreated or suspected status epilepticus.\n Non-availability of EEG should not deter or delay treatment of patients with status epilepticus.\nPatients who are prone to prolonged seizures require specific management (see section 4.11).\n4.10.1 IMMEDIATE MEASURES\nOnce five minutes of seizure activity have passed, treatment should be given as quickly as possible. Initial\nmanagement of such prolonged seizures should be with benzodiazepines. 187 Studies have examined the\ncomparative efficacy and tolerability of midazolam, lorazepam and diazepam. While there is no definitive\nbenefit shown for individual benzodiazepines or modes of administration, choice of route or specific\n1++\nbenzodiazepine will be determined by ease and rapidity of administration, access to appropriately stored drug,\nand patient dignity. Benzodiazeines are safe when given by non-medical staff in an out-of-hospital setting.182\nThe efficacy and safety of intramuscular (IM) midazolam and intravenous (IV) lorazepam is similar, although\nease of administration and ease of storage may favour midazolam (lorazepam requires temperature controlled\nstorage).184 Intramuscular midazolam is not currently licensed for use in patients with status epilepticus.\nAdministration of midazolam via the buccal or intranasal route is not currently licensed in adults and\nevidence for its use is limited. A meta-analysis (six studies, five in paediatric populations) concluded that\nnon-IV midazolam was safe and effective compared to diazepam in treating patients with status epilepticus. 1++\nThree of the studies reported greater effectiveness of buccal midazolam than rectal diazepam, but three 1+\nreported no difference between non-IV midazolm and IV diazepam.176 Two small studies comparing buccal 2+\nmidazolam with rectal diazepam in adults in residential settings showed similar efficacy between the two\nbut greater acceptability of buccal midazolam.188, 189\nOn the basis of evidence in children of ease of use, rapid access, effectiveness and patient dignity, the\nguideline development group consider that buccal/nasal midazolam is the preferred first-line treatment in 1++\nadults.176, 190 Direct evidence for the effectiveness of buccal/intranasal midazolam compared with IV lorazepam\nis currently lacking.\n As soon as possible:\ny secure airway\ny give oxygen\ny assess cardiac and respiratory function\ny secure IV access in large veins. B\n24 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 4 • Treatment\nB Patients with prolonged tonic-clonic seizures that have lasted five minutes or more should be\ngiven:\ny midazolam 10 mg buccally or intranasally, or\ny lorazepam 4 mg IV if midazolam is unavailable, or\ny diazepam 10 mg IV or rectally if midazolam and lorazepam are unavailable.\n4.10.2 IN-HOSPITAL TREATMENT (FOLLOWING FAILURE OF INITIAL BENZODIAZEPINE)\nIf seizures continue despite initial dosing with a benzodiazepine, a second dose of benzodiazepine should be\nadministered in a clinical setting. Where two doses of benzodiazepines have failed, additional maintenance\ntreatment with other AEDs is required. Intravenous phenytoin has been the traditional choice, but there 1+\nis some evidence from head-to-head trials that sodium valproate has similar efficacy with fewer adverse 1-\neffects,191, 192 although the studies were small and at risk of bias. Some smaller studies have suggested\nusefulness of IV levetiracetam on comparison with lorazepam or sodium valproate.193, 194\nThe use of sodium valproate is contraindicated in pregnancy and in women and girls of childbearing potential\n(see section 5.2.0).454 In an emergency, the balance of risks and benefits means that the prime consideration is\nto provide optimal and rapid control of seizures. For maintenance or long-term treatment, the MHRA safety\nadvice, issued in April 2018, on use of valproate medicines in women and girls of childbearing potential\nshould be followed where possible. Specialist review of women and girls of childbearing potential currently\nusing sodium valproate should be initiated following successful resolution of the seizure and continued use\nof sodium valproate in this group should be avoided (see also section 5).\nB Administer a repeat dose of benzodiazepine in hospital after 10 minutes if there is no response.\n • Collect blood for a full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, calcium, glucose,\nclotting, antiepileptic drug levels and storage for later analyses.\ny Measure blood gases to assess the extent of acidosis.\ny Establish aetiology. Give 50 ml of 50% glucose IV if there is any suggestion of hypoglycaemia and\nIV thiamine (given as Pabrinex, two pairs of ampoules) if there is any suggestion of alcohol misuse\nor impaired nutritional status.\n For sustained control in patients with established epilepsy give the usual antiepileptic drug treatment\norally or by nasogastric tube (or IV if necessary for phenytoin, sodium valproate, phenobarbital,\nlevetiracetam or lacosamide).\nD Within 30 minutes, if seizures continue:\ny give sodium valproate 20–30 mg/kg IV 40 mg/min, or phenytoin 18 mg/kg IV 50 mg/min\nwith ECG monitoring. Rates of phenytoin infusion may need to be reduced if hypotension or\narrhythmia occur in older people or where there is renal/hepatic impairment.\n If the patient remains unresponsive after initial treatment, EEG should be utilised to differentiate\nbetween continued seizures and drug-induced sedation (see section 4.10).\n Clear policies should be in place to avoid confusion between doses, formulations, routes and rates of\nadministration of fosphenytoin and phenytoin.\n4.10.3 SEIZURES PERSISTING LONGER THAN 30 MINUTES\nIf seizures persist the patient needs to be admitted to an intensive treatment unit (ITU) and anaesthetised\nwith EEG monitoring to differentiate whether the reduced level of consciousness is seizure- or AED-induced\n4\n(see section 4.10). Midazolam, pentobarbital (unlicensed), propofol or thiopentone are most commonly used\nin these circumstances.195\n| 25\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nD If status persists, then within 60 minutes:\ny admit the patient to an intensive treatment unit and administer general anaesthesia\ny refer for specialist advice.\nD EEG should be used to determine response to treatment.\n4.10.4 NON-CONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS\nClinical manifestations of seizures change with persistence; convulsive movements become minimal or\ndisappear. This may lead to diagnostic difficulty in differentiating reduced level of consciousness due to\nseizure from that caused by sedative or anaesthetic drugs. Persistence of seizure activity is perilous.\nAs with diagnosis of non-epileptic pseudostatus and clinically subtle seizures, EEG monitoring of treatment\nand response of non-convulsive status epilepticus is important (see section 4.10).\n Patients with non-convulsive status epilepticus should be managed as follows:\ny maintain or reinstate usual oral antiepileptic drug treatment\ny consider benzodiazepine treatment (midazolam 10 mg buccally or intranasally, lorazepam 4 mg\nIV, or diazepam 10 mg IV)\ny refer for specialist advice.\nD E EG should be used for diagnosing and monitoring treatment response in patients with non-\nconvulsive status epilepticus.\n Non-availability of EEG should not deter or delay treatment of patients with non-convulsive status\nepilepticus.\n4.11 PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT PROLONGED OR SERIAL SEIZURES IN THE COMMUNITY\nIn some patients, epilepsy is so severe that the occurrence of severe or prolonged seizures is likely to be\nfrequent. In such cases, carers of patients with recurrent prolonged or serial seizure episodes in the community\nmay be able to terminate the seizure episode, prevent the development of status epilepticus and avoid\nunnecessary hospital admission by the administration of buccal or intranasal midazolam 10 mg,176,196,197 or\nrectal diazepam 10–20 mg198,199 close to seizure onset. Buccal/intranasal midazolam is not, however, currently 1++\n1+\nlicensed for use in adults and evidence for its use by carers is derived from studies in children and adolescents.\n1-\nAn agreed and individual written administration protocol set by the specialist team should be followed.200,\n3\n201 The protocol should be a clear written instruction that includes the indications for administering rescue\nmedication, the maximum dose in 24 hours, the drug name, strength, dose and frequency, the route of\nadministration, and when to call for emergency help and transfer to hospital. The protocol should be reviewed\nregularly for efficacy and appropriate usage.\nCarers should receive recognised training on how to follow the administration protocol and the reasons for\nusing rescue medication. Where applicable, they should be encouraged to record seizure episodes, outcomes 4\nand the use of rescue medication in the patient’s care plan.200-202\nB Patients with recurrent prolonged or serial seizures in the community should be initially managed\nby carers who should give midazolam 10 mg buccally or intranasally, or diazepam 10–20 mg\nrectally according to an agreed administration protocol.\nD All carers of patients with epilepsy who may require buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam should\nreceive recognised training in its administration.\nD Where a care plan is required, it should be drawn up in consultation with the GP and/or specialist\nservice, used by everyone working with the individual patient, and reviewed at regular intervals.\n26 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 4 • Treatment\n Protocols for rescue medication should be reviewed regularly and may be withdrawn or amended\nwhere such plans have not been enacted after a prolonged period.\n4.12 DRUGS WHICH EXACERBATE EPILEPTIC SEIZURES\nBoth prescription and illicit drugs can occasionally precipitate seizures particularly in patients with epilepsy.203\nCausality is not always certain and may be multifactorial.\nMechanisms by which drugs may trigger seizures may include:\ny lowering of the seizure threshold. This is usually dose/plasma concentration dependent and factors\nsuch as renal impairment (eg pethidine) or coadministration of interacting drugs (eg ciprofloxacin/\ntheophylline) may contribute\ny decrease in AED levels via pharmacokinetic drug interactions (eg hepatic microsomal enzyme induction 3\nwith rifampicin) 4\ny effects secondary to other medical causes precipitated by drugs (eg drug-induced hyponatraemia or\nserotonin syndrome)\ny individual AEDs which themselves may cause worsening of some types of seizures104\ny drug withdrawal, eg from AEDs, alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and baclofen.204, 205\n All healthcare professionals should be vigilant for prescription of drugs that may cause or exacerbate\nseizures in patients with epilepsy.\n A wide variety of drugs has been reported to precipitate or potentiate seizures in patients with or\nwithout a history of epilepsy. Such theoretical risks should not preclude treatment of recognised\ncomorbidities. Treatment of comorbid psychiatric conditions is covered in section 6.2.\n4.13 MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY IN THE PERIOPERATIVE PERIOD\nLoss of seizure control due to missed oral medication can occur in the context of surgery, labour, and when\nthere is difficulty in swallowing. Sometimes changes in drug doses or frequency will be necessary due to\npharmacokinetic differences between formulations. Patients should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis\nand advice sought from a pharmacist regarding the most suitable alternative preparations, taking into\nconsideration the varying pharmacokinetic drug profiles and route of administration.\n Healthcare professionals should consider the possible consequences of missed antiepileptic drug\ndoses when planning hospital admission.\n Antiepileptic drugs should be administered by alternative routes or by giving additional doses as\nappropriate. When patients have been designated nil by mouth prior to surgery, they should still be\ngiven their usual oral antiepileptic drug unless absorption is impaired.\n When a prolonged problem with administration of drugs not available parenterally is anticipated, and\noral or enteral administration is not possible, consideration should be given to seizure prophylaxis\nwith parenterally available agents.\n Following surgery, the dosage of antiepileptic drug must be checked and confirmed prior to discharge.\n4.14 MANAGEMENT OF OLDER PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY\nOld age is now the commonest time to develop epilepsy in the Western world. The annual incidence is 85.9\nper 100,000 for people aged 65–69 years and 135 per 100,000 for those aged over 80 years.206 The diagnosis\nof epilepsy presents unique difficulties in this age group. Older people with epilepsy have a mortality rate\n2–3 times higher than the general population.\n| 27\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n4.14.1 RISK FACTORS\nDementia and neurodegenerative disorders are estimated to account for 10–20% of all epilepsies in older\npeople, and patients with Alzheimer’s disease are up to ten times more likely to develop epilepsy than those\nwithout the condition.207, 208 Cerebrovascular disease and stroke are important risk factors for developing\nepilepsy. Stroke can account for up to 50% of cases where a cause can be identified, and the risk of epilepsy\nincreases up to 20-fold in the first year after a stroke.207 In an older person with new-onset seizures, it\n3\nis therefore important to undertake cognitive function screening and assessment for the presence of\n4\ncerebrovascular risk factors with an appropriate treatment thereafter. A number of cognitive screening tools\nexist although none has been tested specifically in older people with epilepsy.209\nIn the view of the guideline development group the Abbreviated Mental Test Score may be suitable for use\nin a busy epilepsy clinic,210 although other tools, such as the Addenbrook’s Cognitive Assessment could be\nused where time and resources allow (see section 6.2.3).211\n4.14.2 PRESENTATION\nCharacteristics of presentation can vary later in life. Data suggest that, compared with younger patients, older\npatients are more likely to have a seizure arising from sleep, focal seizures without generalization, remote\nsymptomatic aetiology, focal changes on EEG and an epileptogenic lesion on neuroimaging.212\n4.14.3 ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG TREATMENT\nAntiepileptic drug treatment can be complicated by the frequent coexistence of epilepsy and dementia,\ncomedication, and the increased likelihood of dose-related and idiosyncratic adverse effects. In this\npopulation, the use of carbamazepine is limited by its enzyme inducing properties, implicating the AED in a\nrange of pharmacokinetic interactions.213 The drug also has a propensity to cause hyponatraemia, particularly\nin patients taking diuretics.214\nStudies examining initiation of AED treatment in older people found no significant difference in efficacy\nbetween normal-release carbamazepine, lamotrigine and gabapentin. However, in those with newly\ndiagnosed focal-onset seizures lamotrigine and gabapentin had a better tolerability profile than normal-\nrelease carbamazepine,215 and lamotrigine was better tolerated than sustained-release carbamazepine.216\n1++\nThis was also the case for levetiracetam when compared with sustained-release carbamazepine in those with\n1+\nseizures following a stroke.217 Levetiracetam produced fewer cognitive adverse effects than lamotrigine or\nphenobarbital in older patients with epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease.217 Low-dose topiramate (25–50 mg\ndaily) may also be useful as mono- or adjunctive therapy in older people, although adverse effects including\nsomnolence, dizziness, headache and cognitive-related events have been reported.218\nUntil recently there has been a dearth of research on epilepsy in older people, but the situation is slowly\nchanging. With appropriate management, older people with epilepsy appear to have a better prognosis than\nyounger adults, with a significantly higher percentage becoming seizure free, often on lower AED doses.219\n Any older person developing new-onset seizures should undergo cognitive function screening and\nassessment for the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors, with appropriate management thereafter.\n When choosing an antiepileptic drug for an older person with newly diagnosed epilepsy, consideration\nof the following is paramount:\ny adverse effect profile\ny appropriate formulation\ny dosing regimen in those with adherence issues\ny drug interactions\ny low starting dose\ny slow titration schedule\ny low maintenance dosing.\n28 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 4 • Treatment\nB Lamotrigine or possibly levetiracetam should be considered when starting antiepileptic drug\ntreatment in older people with focal-onset seizures.\nC Gabapentin is an alternative mono- or adjunctive therapy option in older people with epilepsy.\n For older people with cognitive problems, an epilepsy care plan should be considered.\n4.14.4 QUALITY OF LIFE IN OLDER PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY\nDespite a growing appreciation of the importance of quality of life (QoL) issues in the management of\nepilepsy, little empirical guidance is available for older people.220 Studies on health-related quality of life\n1+\n(HRQoL) are heterogeneous. Existing data suggest that although older people might cope better with the\n3\ndiagnosis of epilepsy,221 they feel stigmatised by the condition, with seizure frequency being a significant\npredictor of impaired HRQoL.222\n Clinicians should be aware of the potential impact of epilepsy on HRQoL in older people with epilepsy.\n Further research is needed regarding quality of life issues in older people with epilepsy.\n4.15 MANAGEMENT OF PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITY AND EPILEPSY\nPeople with learning disability and epilepsy should have access to the same range of investigations and\ntreatment as the rest of the population.223, 224 All sections of this guideline are, therefore, relevant to people\n4\nwith learning disability, in particular those on management of prolonged seizures (see section 4.10) and\nmortality in epilepsy, including SUDEP (see section 8).\nUse of sodium valproate must take into account MHRA safety advice, issued in April 2018, on use of valproate\nmedicines in women and girls of childbearing potential and the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention\nProgramme (see section 5.2.0).454\nEpilepsy associated with learning disability is common with the prevalence highest (about 50%) in people with\nsevere disability and cerebral palsy.225 In some adults with learning disability it may be difficult to distinguish\n4\nepilepsy from psychiatric illness, emotional and behavioural states and where doubts exist, videorecording\nof the episode, with appropriate consent, may help to secure diagnosis.224, 226\nQuality of life in people with learning disability and epilepsy may be affected because of injuries sustained\nduring seizures and because of the adverse effects of medication.227 In situations where RCTs, of appropriate\n1++\ndesign, have been performed, it has been shown that adverse effects of AEDs in people with a learning\n4\ndisability are similar to those of the general population and that behavioural adverse effects are rare.228\nSeizure freedom is an appropriate endpoint for many people with learning disability and epilepsy.\nThe confidential enquiry into premature deaths of people with a learning disability found that, within the\nNHS, people with learning disabilities continue to have poor experience and outcomes compared to those\nwithout and an excess mortality has also been reported.229 The government response to this enquiry makes\nseveral recommendations including emphasising the need to make reasonable adjustment for any individual\nto enable them to effectively access care.230\n4\nClinical guidelines exist for the management of epilepsy in adults with an intellectual disability.231, 232 In\nsituations where the person cannot give informed consent, treatment may need to be given under the\nprovisions of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000.\nIn adults with Down’s Syndrome, seizures can be a presenting symptom of dementia and over 80% of people\nwith Down’s Syndrome and dementia develop seizures. The most common type of seizures in these patients\nare generalised tonic-clonic seizures and myoclonic seizures although other seizure types may be seen.\nGuidelines exist for the management of epilepsy in those with Down’s Syndrome and dementia.233\n| 29\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nD People with learning disability should be treated with the same range of antiepileptic drugs as\nthe general population.\n In the management of people with learning disability and epilepsy:\ny adequate time should be allowed for the consultation\ny the carer should know the patient and bring relevant information on seizure type, frequency,\npossible adverse effects of medication, general health and behaviour to the consultation\ny information in an accessible form should be available to patients and carers\ny there should be a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, delivered by professionals with an\nexpertise in epilepsy, to improve quality of life\ny community learning disability nurses have an important role in liaising between the specialist\nservices and patients and carers.\n In people with Down’s Syndrome and dementia who develop seizures, quality of life, including negative\nimpact of all seizure types and medication adverse effects, should guide treatment.\n The quality of information brought to appointments is highly variable and therefore the validity of\nthis information should be thoroughly checked.\n30 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 5 • Epilepsy and women’s health\n5 Epilepsy and women’s health\nWomen with epilepsy of childbearing potential need advice about contraception and pregnancy as well\nas information about epilepsy management. Those who have received such advice are likely to have more\nreliable contraception, better health during pregnancy and improved pregnancy outcomes.234 In addition\nto seizure type or syndrome, the choice of AED for women may be influenced by factors including potential\nteratogenicity, interactions with hormonal methods of contraception, and potential cosmetic adverse effects.\nIn the UK, despite modern advances in epilepsy and obstetric management, epilepsy remains one of the\nleading contributors to maternal mortality.235\nIn September 2018, this section was updated to reflect new drug safety advice from the Medicines and\nHealthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), issued in April 2018, on use of valproate medicines and\nwomen and girls of childbearing potiental (see section 5.2.0).454\n5.1 CONTRACEPTION\nFor women with epilepsy, advice on methods of contraception should be given early, ideally before they\nbecome sexually active. Advice should be based on a full understanding of the pharmacokinetics of AED\ntreatment and the possibility of drug interactions. To avoid contraceptive failure, worsening seizures or\nneurotoxicity, when practical, these women should be offered contraceptive methods that do not interact\nwith their AED treatment.\nContraceptive pathways for women with epilepsy are summarised in Figure 1. Postpartum contraception is\ncovered in section 5.7.1. Methods of emergency contraception are discussed in section 5.1.2\nFor women with epilepsy, advice on hormonal contraception depends largely on the AED regimen, in\nparticular, its hepatic enzyme-inducing characteristics.236 AEDs can broadly be divided into those which induce 1+\nhepatic enzymes (thus reducing the efficacy of some contraceptives) and those which do not (see Table 3).\nTable 3: Action of AEDs on hepatic enzymes213\nAEDs which induce hepatic enzymes Non-enzyme inducing AEDs\n(and reduce efficacy of some contraceptive methods)\ncarbamazepine acetazolamide\neslicarbazepine acetate clobazam\noxcarbazepine clonazepam\nperampanel (≥12 mg daily) ethosuximide\nphenobarbital gabapentin\nphenytoin lacosamide\nprimidone *lamotrigine\nrufinamide levetiracetam\ntopiramate (≥200 mg daily) pregabalin\nretigabine\nsodium valproate\ntiagabine\nvigabatrin\nzonisamide\n* Combined hormonal contraceptives affect the metabolism of lamotrigine (see section 5.1.1)\n| 31\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nWomen with epilepsy receiving hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs (see Table 3) are at risk of contraceptive failure\nif any form of combined hormonal contraception is used.236 Those taking the combined oral contraception\npill (COCP) are at increased risk of breakthrough bleeding and contraceptive failure, estimated at up to 7 per\n100 woman years, due to accelerated oestrogen metabolism.236-239 If there is no option but to use a COCP 1+\nwith a hepatic enzyme-inducing AED, the risk of breakthrough bleeding can be reduced by using a COCP 2-\n4\ncontaining a minimum of 50 micrograms ethinyl oestradiol increasing to 70 micrograms if breakthrough\nbleeding occurs.240 Even with these measures there is a risk of pregnancy, and expert opinion advises\n’tricycling’, ie taking three packs of the high dose COCP consecutively and reducing pill-free days to four (see\nFigure 1).241 Enzyme induction can last for 14–28 days after withdrawl of the AED.213\nEnzyme-inducing AEDs increase progesterone metabolism and should not, therefore, be prescribed with\neither the progesterone-only oral contraceptive, the etonogestrel implant or the levonorgestrel implant.236, 242 1+\nProgesterone injections and the levonorgestrel intrauterine system can be used with enzyme-inducing AEDs 2+\nalthough there is some evidence that depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is associated with a reduction 4\nin bone mineral density.243\n5.1.1 LAMOTRIGINE\nAlthough lamotrigine is not thought to affect the efficacy of COCPs,244 circulating lamotrigine concentrations\nare halved through glucuronidation induction by COCPs containing ethinyloestradiol/levonorgestrel.236\nHealthcare professionals should warn patients about this and be aware that lamotrigine dosing may need to\n1+\nbe altered accordingly if these two medications are used together. This effect is negated when lamotrigine\nis prescribed with sodium valproate which inhibits lamotrigine glucuronidation.\nOne small study in women taking progestogen-only contraception reported a 20–100% increase in lamotrigine\ncirculating concentrations in women receiving the AED with desogestrel.245 If these medications are prescribed 3\ntogether, women should therefore be counselled about the possibility of neurotoxicity symptoms.\n Advice on contraception should be given to young women, ideally before they become sexually active.\n For women with epilepsy not receiving antiepileptic drugs and for those receiving antiepileptic drugs\nthat do not induce hepatic enzymes (other than lamotrigine), contraceptive options are the same as\nthose for women in general.\nC To minimise the risk of contraceptive failure, a woman using any combined hormonal contraception,\nor a combined oral contraceptive pill, or a progesterone-only pill should be prescribed an\nantiepileptic drug that does not induce hepatic enzymes.\nD For women receiving hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs:\ny the levonorgestrel intrauterine system may be used without restriction\ny depot injections of progestogen may be used without restriction and with no alteration to the\nnormal dosing/replacement interval\ny progestogen-only oral contraceptives are not recommended\ny progestogen implants (levonorgestrel and etonogestrel) are not recommended\ny if there is no alternative to a COCP, the COCP should contain at least 50 micrograms daily of\noestrogen; if the COCP contains less oestrogen, the woman should be warned that the efficacy\nis reduced and additional barrier methods should be used\ny if breakthrough bleeding occurs with a COCP containing 50 micrograms of oestrogen, the COCP\ndose should be increased to a maximum of 70 micrograms and ‘tricycling’ should be considered\ny if the antiepileptic drug is withdrawn, it is important to note that enzyme induction persists\nfor up to four weeks. Contraceptive cover should be ensured during this time.\n32 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 5 • Epilepsy and women’s health\nD Women with epilepsy receiving lamotrigine:\ny can use progestogen-only contraceptives without restriction. These women should be made\naware of signs and symptoms of lamotrigine toxicity, and have the lamotrigine dose reduced\nif these occur.\ny and combined hormonal contraceptives should be counselled about the reduction in circulating\nlamotrigine concentrations and the potential for, and consequences of, increased seizure\nactivity. The healthcare professional should also discuss the possibility of increasing the\nlamotrigine dose with the patient.\ny and combined hormonal contraceptives should be warned about signs and symptoms of\nlamotrigine toxicity if the contraceptive is withdrawn. A reduction in lamotrigine dosing may\nbe necessary at this time.\n Further research examining the use of lamotrigine with hormonal contraception is required.\n5.1.2 EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION\nOptions for emergency contraception for women with epilepsy depend on whether or not the woman is\ntaking an enzyme-inducing AED. Women who are not taking AEDs or who are taking non-enzyme inducing\nAEDs can use emergency contraception as for women in the general population.\nHepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs increase the metabolism of levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate. Current\n4\nguidance recommends that ulipristal acetate should be avoided in women taking hepatic enzyme-inducing\nAEDs and that levonorgestrel, if used, is prescribed at double the normal dose, although this is outwith the\ncurrent product licence.246\nHealthcare professionals caring for women with epilepsy should discuss individual needs and inform women\nof the methods available to them.

This gives an opportunity to review the diagnosis and seizure control, discuss AED adherence 2+\nand SUDEP risk, rationalise AED therapy, prescribe folic acid and discuss genetic factors.234\nThe success of prepregnancy counselling is determined by a combination of access to care, attitudes, and\nthe social context of the woman. Identifying women with epilepsy at risk of unplanned pregnancy and\n3\ntailoring counselling accordingly may reduce adverse outcomes.249 The provision of information during\nregular structured reviews in primary care is also important (see section 9.1).\nPrepregnancy counselling of women with epilepsy should encompass (see Annex 2):\ny reassurance that the majority of women with epilepsy will have a normal pregnancy and delivery250\ny reassurance that the majority of women will be seizure-free during pregnancy and that those who are\nseizure-free prior to becoming pregnant are likely to remain seizure-free during pregnancy251 2++\n3\ny advice on continuing AED treatment during pregnancy at the recommended doses, as poor adherence\n4\nduring pregnancy can lead to problems with seizures252\ny advice on smoking cessation for women with epilepsy who smoke, as smoking in this population is\nassociated with a substantially higher risk of premature contractions, pre term labour and delivery\ncompared with women with epilepsy who do not smoke.251\nWomen with epilepsy should:\nB • receive prepregnancy counselling at the time of diagnosis and at regular intervals during\ntheir management, especially if they are taking antiepileptic drug treatment\nD • be reassured that most will have a normal pregnancy and delivery\nC • have their diagnosis and treatment, if appropriate, reviewed by specialist services before\nconception; a concerted effort should be made to optimise seizure control and rationalise\nantiepileptic drug therapy prior to conception\nD • be well informed about pregnancy and epilepsy-related issues, including smoking cessation,\nbefore conception.\n5.2.0 SODIUM VALPROATE\nIn April 2018 the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued new drug safety\nadvice stating that valproate medicines must no longer be used in women or girls of childbearing potential\nunless the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met and there is no suitable alternative\ntreatment, as judged by a specialist experienced in the management of epilepsy. Valproate medicines are\nteratogenic and can cause physical birth defects in babies and neurodevelopmental disorders in children\nborn to mothers taking valproate (see section 5.6).454 A Patient Guide and supporting documents are available\nfrom MHRA.\nDue to these concerns and the concomitant need to avoid pregnancy, the MHRA recommends that all female\npatients taking valproate medicines are supported on a Pregnancy Prevention Programme, that ensures they:\ny have been told and understand the risks of use in pregnancy and have signed a Risk Acknowldgement\nForm454\ny are on highly effective contraception if necessary454\ny see their specialist at least every year.454\nThis condition applies unless the prescriber considers that there are compelling reasons to indicate that\nthere is no risk of pregnancy.454\n| 35\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n Where sodium valproate is prescirbed for women or girls of childbearing potential,:\ny a pregnancy test should be carried out beforehand to exclude pregnancy\n(unless there are compelling reasons to indicate that there is no risk of pregnancy)\ny the lowest dose possible should be used.\n5.2.1 FOLIC ACID\nWomen with epilepsy taking AEDs are at increased risk, compared to the general population, of having\n2++\na child with neural tube defects (NTDs) and other malformations which may be related to altered folate\n2+\nmetabolism.253-255 The prevalence of congenital abnormalities is higher with sodium valproate than with\n3\nother AEDs and rises with increasing number of AEDs taken (see section 5.6).256\nAs for all women, those with epilepsy should take daily folic acid from preconception and throughout the\nfirst trimester of pregnancy.256-261 There is increasing evidence from pregnancy registers to suggest that\ntaking folic acid preconceptually and for at least the first 12 weeks of pregnancy may reduce the incidence\nof major congenital malformations in the offspring of women with epilepsy, particularly those receiving AED 2+\ntreatment,256, 260-262 although not all studies show a relationship.259, 263 In women receiving sodium valproate, 4\nfolic acid may also significantly reduce the rate of spontaneous miscarriage, with a non-significant reduction\nfor carbamazepine.264 A prospective multicentre study of cognitive outcomes at age six in children of women\nprescribed sodium valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine or phenytoin monotherapy, reported that mean\nIQs were higher in children whose mothers had taken preconceptual folate, than in those who had not, but\nconcluded that these results should be interpreted with caution as information on folate was obtained from\nmothers via a retrospective interview.265\nAlthough there are insufficient data to guide dosing,266 given that several AEDs are folate antagonists high\ndose folic acid, at 5 mg daily, is generally recommended for women with epilepsy receiving AED treatment.267 1++\nFor women with epilepsy not taking AEDs, folic acid should be given as recommended for women without 2+\n4\nepilepsy (400 micrograms daily), unless they have a family history of or a previous child with a neural tube\ndefect, or a body mass index >30, when 5 mg daily should be taken.268-270\nCertain AEDs, in particular phenytoin and phenobarbital, may exert their teratogenic effect through\n2+\nmechanisms other than depletion of folic acid.259, 263 Research into these mechanisms is required.\nC Women with epilepsy trying to conceive or who present in the first trimester should be advised\nto take folic acid during this time to reduce the risk of major congenital malformations.\nD Women receiving sodium valproate should be advised that folic acid supplementation may reduce\nthe rate of spontaneous miscarriage.\nFolic acid dosing:\nA 400 micrograms daily for:\ny women with epilepsy not receiving antiepileptic drug treatment\n5 mg daily for:\nD y women with epilepsy receiving antiepileptic drug treatment\nA y women with epilepsy not on antiepileptic drug treatment, but with a family history of or a\nprevious child with a neural tube defect\nA y women with epilepsy not on antiepileptic drug treatment, but with a BMI >30.\n Research into the mechanisms underlying antiepileptic drug-associated teratogenic effects is required.\n5.3 RISKS OF INHERITING EPILEPSY\nEpilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder resulting from multiple genetic and non-genetic factors.271 Chromosomal\nand single gene disorders causing epilepsy are rare. Over the past few decades, much progress has been\n36 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 5 • Epilepsy and women’s health\nmade in the field of epilepsy genetics. Risk prediction for most patients and families relies on results of\nepidemiologic studies which look at the risk of epilepsy in family members of individuals with the condition.\nMothers with epilepsy have higher rates of having affected offspring (2.8–8.7%) compared to fathers\nwith epilepsy (1.0–3.6%).272 The risks of passing on epilepsy are higher for mothers with genetic than with\nsymptomatic epilepsies.\nParental age at onset of epilepsy also predicts risk to offspring. Parents with onset of epilepsy before the\nage of 20 have a 2.3–6% risk of having offspring with epilepsy; onset after age 20 confers a 1.0–3.6% risk.\n2++\nNo increased risk to offspring of individuals has been found with epilepsy beginning after age 35.273 The risk\n2+\n3 increases with the number of affected individuals in each family, and is also raised if there are specific EEG\nabnormalities in family members.\n5.3.1 GENETIC GENERALISED EPILEPSIES\nThe reported risk of inheriting GGEs varies from study to study. A retrospective study gives risk of any type\n2+ of seizure in a child of a mother with GGE as 4–8%; in a child of a father with GGE, the risk is only slightly\n4 higher than that for the general population.30 When more than one first-degree relative is affected the risk of\na child being affected is higher, sometimes approaching 30% or more. Another study of first-degree relatives\nfound that for an affected individual, risk of GGE in a sibling was 2.5–6.7% and for children was 1.6–6.3%.274\nThe genetic contribution to epilepsy appears limited to epilepsy with onset aged under 35 years.273, 275 Multiple\ngenes influence the phenotypes of genetic generalized epilepsy.276 Genetic susceptibility in patients with\n2+\nGGE increases the risk of epilepsy associated with cerebral palsy. Photosensitive genetic epilepsy is inherited\n3\nin an autosomal dominant manner with age-dependent penetrance of the photoparoxysmal response.\n4\nDuring maximum penetrance between the ages of 5 and 15, 50% of children of a photosensitive parent,\nwill be photosensitive.277\n5.3.2 FOCAL EPILEPSIES\nIn relatives of patients with non-genetic focal epilepsy, there is no evidence for a significantly increased\n2+\nrisk of epilepsy.273, 275 In genetic focal epilepsies the risks are higher. For example, in parents with autosomal\n3\ndominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy the risk of a child developing this disorder may be up to 50%, 4\ndepending on penetrance.278\n5.3.3 FEBRILE CONVULSIONS\nSusceptibility to febrile convulsions also follows a multifactorial polygenic mode of inheritance with a\nmaternal preponderance in transmission. There is a 27% risk in a child with an affected mother and 6% with 3\nan affected father.279 Population-based studies indicate that 2–7% of children with febrile seizures will go 4\non to develop epilepsy with afebrile seizures, the risk being higher with complicated febrile convulsions.28\n5.3.4 RECENT GENETIC ADVANCES\nNovel technologies and international collaboration have resulted in identification of new genes for monogenic\nand complex genetic epilepsies as well as risk factors for adverse effects of AEDs. There is the promise of\nfurther major advances in the years ahead which may allow more accurate prediction of inheritance risk,\nenhancing a new dimension to epilepsy management.75\nFor all patients with epilepsy, a comprehensive family history of epilepsy should be taken and expert advice\non the genetics of epilepsy should be available as required.\n For most patients, reassurance can be given that, in general, the risk of epilepsy developing in the\nchildren of parents with epilepsy is low.\n| 37\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n5.4 PREGNANCY\nEpilepsy is a common maternal neurological disorder requiring management during pregnancy281 and\npopulation-based studies estimate that 0.7% of pregnancies occur in women with the condition.282 In\nScotland, this equates to 400 births per year in women with epilepsy (based on 2011 data)283 or 35 babies\n3\nper year in a maternity unit with 5,000 births annually. Information on pregnancy outcomes and factors\nwhich may influence these pregnancy outcomes is important for counselling women during pregnancy\nand the puerperium.\nA proposed management approach for women and girls treated with AEDs is shown in Figure 2.\nPreconceptual counselling is important for all women with epilepsy and should include review by specialist\nservices (see section 5.2). The need to review AED use is heightened by the teratogenic nature of some AEDs,\nparticularly sodium valproate. Safety advice issued by MHRA, in April 2018, on use of valproate medicines\nin women and girls of childbearing potential should be taken into account along with the conditions of the\nPregnancy Prevention Programme (see section 5.2.0).454\n Pregnancies in women with epilepsy should be supervised in an obstetric clinic with access to an\nobstetrician with a special interest in medical disorders in pregnancy and an epilepsy specialist.\n5.4.1 SEIZURE CONTROL DURING PREGNANCY\nIn women with epilepsy, there are no data comparing seizure control in pregnancy to that of non-pregnant\nwomen.251 Evidence suggests that in the majority of women with epilepsy, seizure frequency during pregnancy 2++\n2+\nis improved or unchanged,250, 282, 284 and 50% or more are seizure free throughout pregnancy.262, 285-287\nWomen with epilepsy who are seizure free for nine months or more prior to becoming pregnant are likely to\nremain seizure free (84–92%) during pregnancy.251 Seizure control is more likely to be a problem in women\n3\nwith focal-onset than with primary generalized seizures (47% v 58.7% recurrence),250, 288 and women taking\npolytherapy during pregnancy are more likely to have seizures than those taking monotherapy.250, 286, 287\nMaternal morbidity and mortality\nAlthough uncommon, the risks to a woman of injury and, rarely, death as a consequence of seizures persist\nin pregnancy.235, 289 In the UK, epilepsy remains one of the leading contributors to maternal mortality and\nbetween 2009 and 2012 was associated with 14 maternal deaths during pregnancy and up to six weeks post\npartum, a rate of 0.40 per 10,000 pregnancies (95% CI 0.22 to 0.68). Twelve of these maternal deaths were\ndue to SUDEP, two in women in single rooms in hospital.235 Most of the 14 women who died did not receive 3\npreconceptual counselling and half of the women were not referred to an epilepsy specialist during pregnancy,\ndespite a known history of epilepsy. In addition, a further 12 women with epilepsy died between six weeks\nand one year after the end of their pregnancy, two from drowning, six from SUDEP and four following other\ncomplications of seizures.\nThe frequency of status epilepticus in women with epilepsy during pregnancy is 0.55% to 1.8%.250, 251, 284 The 2++\ncondition is associated with fetal as well as maternal mortality (see section 4.10). There is insufficient evidence 3\n4\nto determine if this rate of status epilepticus differs to that in non-pregnant women with epilepsy.251\nD As good seizure control during pregnancy is more likely in women whose seizures are controlled\nprior to becoming pregnant an effort should be made to optimise seizure control prior to pregnancy\n(particularly for generalised tonic-clonic seizures).\n Women with epilepsy who are pregnant or who have recently been pregnant and who require hospital\nadmission should not be placed in a single room.\n38 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 5 • Epilepsy and women’s health\n5.4.2 AED DOSES AND BLOOD LEVEL MONITORING DURING PREGNANCY\nPregnancy is associated with pharmacokinetic changes including an increase in the volume of drug\ndistribution, an increase in drug metabolism through hepatic microsomal enzyme induction, a reduction in\nserum albumin concentration and an increase in renal clearance.290 There is a tendency for plasma levels of\n3\nAEDs to fall during pregnancy, particularly for lamotrigine and levetiracetam,287, 291, 292 but the implications\n3\nfor seizure control and frequency are difficult to predict.\n4\nThe value of plasma AED monitoring in pregnancy is uncertain. Total plasma levels may be misleading and\nthe relationship between free AED levels and seizure control is complex.287, 293 Plasma level monitoring may\noccasionally be of use when there is concern about toxicity or adherence to therapy.294\nPhenytoin circulating concentrations tend to correlate with seizure control and measurement can be\nworthwhile.293 Recent data suggest poor seizure control and epilepsy-related death might be more common\n2+\nfor patients receiving lamotrigine as opposed to other monotherapies, and that a more robust approach to\n3\nadjusting lamotrigine dosing at this time is required.250, 295 As lamotrigine clearance increases throughout\n4\npregnancy, monitoring of circulating lamotrigine concentrations, although not widely available, may also\nbe a useful tool to aid adjustment of dose during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.291, 296, 297\nFurther research is needed to determine best practice in managing lamotrigine dosing in pregnant women\nwith epilepsy.\nD In pregnancy, dosing adjustment for the majority of antiepileptic drugs (with the exception of\n2++ lamotrigine and levetiracetam) should only be considered if there is a change in seizure frequency\n2+\nor if toxicity is suspected.\nD Healthcare professionals should be aware that the dose of lamotrigine may need to be increased\n3 during pregnancy. To avoid postpartum neurotoxicity, the lamotrigine dose should be reduced\nearly in the puerperium.\n As AED concentrations may fall during pregnancy, healthcare professionals need to be aware that\ndosing may need to be increased.\n If seizure control deteriorates during pregnancy, other factors affecting AED levels in pregnancy should\nbe considered (for example vomiting, interactions with other medication).\n3  For pregnant women with epilepsy, routine monitoring of AED concentrations is not indicated.\nHowever, the measurement of AED concentrations can be useful in the following circumstances: for\nadjustment of phenytoin dose, assessment of AED adherence and suspected AED toxicity.\n The interpretation of AED blood levels is best performed by an epilepsy specialist.\n Issues relating to AED blood level monitoring must be discussed with the patient.\n5.4.3 PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS\nEvidence comparing obstetric complications during pregnancy in women with or without epilepsy is\ninconclusive.\nIn women with epilepsy there is insufficient evidence to support or refute:251\ny an increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension\ny an increased risk of pre-eclampsia in those taking AEDs.\n2++\nOne UK study found that the general obstetric complication rate (comprising vaginal bleeding, urinary\ninfection, hypertension, breech presentation, fetal distress and multiple pregnancy) was higher in women\nwith treated epilepsy than controls, but not for any single complication.262\n| 39\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nHepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs (see Table 3) increase the metabolism of corticosteroids used for the\nprevention of neonatal respiratory morbidity. Women taking hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs who require 2++\nantenatal corticosteroids should, therefore, receive double the normal dose.213\nRecommendations for administration of vitamin K to infants born to women with epilepsy do not differ\n1\nfrom those for all infants and 1 mg of intramuscular vitamin K at birth should be offered, unless there are\n1\ncontraindications.298 If there are additional risk factors for haemorrhagic disease of the newborn (for example 4\nmaternal liver disease, anticipated premature delivery), consideration should be given to the administration\nof oral vitamin K (phytomenadione at 10 mg daily) in the third trimester of pregnancy.299\n1\nD Pregnant women with epilepsy receiving hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs who require\nantenatal corticosteroids for the prevention of neonatal respiratory morbidity, should receive\ndouble the standard dose of betamethasone/dexamethasone (48 mg over 12–24 hours).\nD All infants of women with epilepsy should be offered vitamin K , 1 mg intramuscularly at birth,\n1\nunless there are contraindications.\nD If there are additional risk factors for haemorrhagic disease of the newborn (for example maternal\nliver disease, anticipated premature delivery) consideration should be given to the maternal\nadministration of oral vitamin K (phytomenadione 10 mg daily) in the third trimester of pregnancy.\n1\n5.5 LABOUR AND BIRTH\nMost women with epilepsy will have a normal labour and a vaginal delivery at term.252, 262, 300 Stress, pain,\n2++\nsleep deprivation, overbreathing and dehydration increase the risk of seizures during labour and birth. If 3\ntonic-clonic seizures occur during labour, maternal hypoxia, fetal hypoxia and acidosis may result. 4\n Women with epilepsy should be delivered in a consultant-led maternity unit.\n When a woman with epilepsy presents in the early stages of labour, a low threshold for admission to\nthe maternity unit should be adopted.\n During labour, one-to-one midwifery care should be given.\n Factors predisposing to increased risk of seizures in labour should be reduced as much as possible\nand there should be a low threshold for epidural anaesthesia.\nD The usual oral antiepileptic drug should be continued during labour and in the postnatal period.\nEvery effort should be made to ensure that no doses are missed. In women with epilepsy who are\nunable to tolerate oral medication, the antiepileptic drug can be given by other routes.\n40 |\n| 41\nContinue\nto\nmonitor\nlower AED dose(s)\nteratogenic\nAED\nopportunity to Explore\nSwitch\nto\nless\nconsistently formulation brand/use\none\n• Prescribe\nby\n• Optimise\ndose\nNo\nYes\n• Counselling\nAED?\nalternatives\nTaking teratogenic\nYes\nConsider\nsuitable\nNo\nYes\nimpairment\nwith sodium valproate\n•\nAdvise\nof\nrisk\nof neurodevelopmental\nNo\npregnancy\nAED(s)\n•\nAdvise\nof\nteratogenic\nrisk of\nAEDs\nUnplanned\nAdvise\nto keep taking\ndiagnosis\nand\ntreatment\n•\nRefer\nfor\nspecialist\nreview of\nManaged\nwithdrawal\nof AED\nSeizure\nrecurrence?\ncounselling\npregnancy\nimpairment\nwith sodium valproate\nPlanning\na\nC p o r m ec p o r n e c h e e p n t s u iv a e l\n• •\nA A\nd d\nv v\ni i s s e e\no o\nf f r te is\nr k a t o o f g n e e n u i r c o r d is e k v o e\nf lo\nA p E m D\ne s ntal\nif se 2 i – z 3 u r y e e f a r r e s e ? for\non work/lifestyle)\nNo\nYes\nstatus\nepilepticus\n(impact\ntreatment\nwithdrawing AED\nDiscuss\nrisk\nof\nSUDEP\nand\ninformation\nspecialist\nreview\nof diagnosis\nand\nConsider\nappropriate\ncare and\n•\nRefer\nfor\npreconception\nadvice\nand\nensure\npatient receives\n•\nGP\ninvolvement to\nchildhood\nto adulthood\nContraception\nadvice\ngirl\nStart\nfolic acid 5mg/day\nand\ntransition from\nTeenage\nadult\n(specialist) services\nhandover\nfrom child\nto\nprescribing\npatient’s AED\n•\nEnsure\nappropriate\n•\nMust\nbe\nguided\nby specialist\n-\nSUDEP\nrisk\nPlanning pregnancy\n•\nTreatment\nreview\n-\nmedication\nadherence\nfuture\npregnancy\n•\nInvolve\nfamily/carers\n-\nclassification\nAED\nrisk:benefit\ncontraception\nand\n•\nAdvice\non contraception\n-\ndiagnosis\n•\nInformation\non\npartum\ndiscussion\nof\npregnancy\nchecklist\ninformation\ncare\nclinic\nfollow-up/post-\ntreated\nwith\nAEDs\nand\nrisks of AEDs during\ntake\nplace\nwith\nGP using\ntreatment\nunplanned)\nneurology\nshared\nassessment\nand\ngirl\nwith\nepilepsy\nmanagement\nof epilepsy\nopportunistically;\ndiscussion\nmay\nof diagnosis and\n(planned\nor\n•\nObstetric/\n•\nNeurodevelopmental\nWoman/teenage\n•\nCounselling\nabout\n•\nIntroduce\npreconceptual\nissues\nSpecialist review\nIf\npregnant\nFigure 2: Proposed management approach for women and teenage girls with epilepsy treated with antiepileptic drugs*\nReproduced with permission from: Epilepsy Expert Group - Clinical management algorithm for women and girls with\nepilepsy treated with antiepileptic drugs248\nof\nthe\nPregnancy\nPrevention\nProgramme. 454\nwomen\nand\ngirls\nof\nchildbearing\npotential and\nthe\nconditions\nadvice,\nissued\nin\nApril\n2018,\non\nuse of valproate\nmedicines\nin\n*\nUse\nof\nsodium\nvalproate\nmust\ntake into account\nMHRA\nsafety\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 5 • Epilepsy and women’s health\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n5.5.1 SEIZURES IN LABOUR\nApproximately 3.5–5% of women with epilepsy will have a seizure during labour and birth.284, 285 Intrapartum\n2+\nseizures are more common in those with antenatal seizures284 and occur more frequently in women with\n3\nprimary generalised seizures than in women with focal-onset seizures.301\nThere are no clinical trials to inform choice of emergency treatment of intrapartum seizures for women with\nepilepsy. If the seizure persists, this should be managed as for status epilepticus (see section 4.10).\nD • Intrapartum generalised tonic-clonic seizures that are not due to eclampsia should be\nterminated as soon as possible.\ny If the seizure persists, this should be managed as for status epilepticus.\n Maternal airway and oxygenation should be maintained at all times.\n If there is doubt whether a seizure in labour is due to eclampsia or epilepsy, a slow intravenous bolus\nof 4 g magnesium sulphate over five minutes followed by 1 g/hour for 24 hours is recommended in\naddition to midazolam, lorazepam or diazepam.\n Following a generalised tonic-clonic seizure during labour (irrespective of aetiology) delivery should\nbe expedited once the maternal condition is stable. Neonatal expertise should be available.\n5.5.2 INDUCTION OF LABOUR\nInduction of labour should be offered to women with epilepsy for standard obstetric indications. Epilepsy, in\nitself, is not an indication for induction of labour and there is no evidence to show that induction of labour\nis associated with improved pregnancy outcomes. It may, nevertheless, be reasonable to consider induction\nof labour in a woman with poorly controlled seizures at term.\n In women with epilepsy, induction of labour should be offered for standard obstetric indications.\n5.5.3 CAESAREAN SECTION\nEpilepsy alone is not an indication for Caesarean section and there is no evidence to show that Caesarean\nsection is associated with improved pregnancy outcomes in women with epilepsy. Delivery by elective\nCaesarean section may, however, be appropriate for a woman with frequent tonic-clonic or prolonged focal\nseizures towards the end of pregnancy.\nEvidence on whether or not women with epilepsy are at substantially increased risk (greater than two times\n2++\nexpected) of delivery by Caesarean section is conflicting.262, 282, 302 Higher rates have been found in women\n3\nwith active seizures,285 and those taking AEDs.251\nFurther research on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes following induction of labour and Caesarean section\nfor women with epilepsy is required\n A history of epilepsy alone is not an indication for delivery by Caesarean section. Elective Caesarean\nsection should be considered if there have been frequent tonic-clonic or prolonged focal seizures\nduring the third trimester of pregnancy in order to avoid adverse outcomes associated with intrapartum\nseizures.\n42 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 5 • Epilepsy and women’s health\n5.5.4 OBSTETRIC HAEMORRHAGE\nEvidence on whether or not women with epilepsy are at increased risk of bleeding complications is\n2+\ninconsistent. A systematic review demonstrated no increased risk,251 but a large population-based study\n3 2++\ndemonstrated an increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage in women with epilepsy compared to those\nwithout epilepsy, particularly for those taking AEDs (odds ratio (OR) 1.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9).303\nFurther research into postpartum haemorrhage rates in women with epilepsy is required. Outcome data\ncould be incorporated into existing pregnancy registers.\n5.6 FETAL, NEONATAL AND CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES\nThe effect of maternal epilepsy on fetal and infant outcomes is unclear and data from studies are inconsistent.\nThese inconsistencies may be due to geographical factors and social differences between different\npopulations, differences in the aetiology of epilepsies, and differences in the management of epilepsy and\npregnancy.\n5.6.1 RISKS TO THE FETUS FROM MATERNAL SEIZURES\nThe majority of women with epilepsy will have unchanged or improved seizure frequency during pregnancy\n(see section 5.4.1) although up to one third will experience an increase in seizure frequency.287, 304 This increase\n3\nmay be due to a number of factors including changes in AED pharmacokinetics and poor adherence to\ntreatment because of concerns about teratogenicity.252\nThe long term effect of maternal seizures on the fetus is not well established, although in theory the associated\nhypoxia and acidosis could adversely affect fetal outcomes, particularly if seizures are frequent and prolonged.\nD Pregnant women with epilepsy should be made aware of the risks of uncontrolled seizures both\nto themselves and to their developing fetus.\n5.6.2 RISKS TO THE FETUS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS\nEpilepsy is common in women of childbearing age and exposure of the fetus to AEDs occurs in approximately\n1 in 250 pregnancies.206\nWomen with epilepsy are more likely than women without epilepsy to give birth to children with congenital\n2++\nmalformations (CMs).256, 259, 260, 262, 263, 305, 306 Untreated epilepsy does not appear to be associated with an\n2+\nincreased risk of CM,307 but major and minor fetal malformations occur more commonly in infants exposed\n3\nto AEDs during pregnancy.252, 308-310\n2++\nThe overall risk of major congenital malformation (MCM) in the general population is approximately 2%.\n3 2+\n252, 311, 312 The risk increases in women taking a single AED (see section 5.6.3) or multiple AEDs (see section 5.6.4).\n A detailed assessment of fetal anatomy to detect fetal congenital abnormalities should be offered to\nall pregnant women with epilepsy at 18–20 weeks gestation.\n5.6.3 RISKS TO THE FETUS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG MONOTHERAPY\nThe reported rates of MCMs associated with different AED monotherapies vary from study to study and\ndifferent methodological approaches make comparison between studies difficult. Rates are, however,\nconsistently higher for sodium valproate than for other AEDs (see Table 4).\n| 43\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nTable 4: Absolute risk of major congenital malformation risks with AED monotherapy313\nAED MCM risk\n*Sodium valproate 11.3%262\n10.7%312\n8.9%314\n7.5%315\n6.3%316\n6.2%263\n*Carbamazepine 5.2%316\n4.6%312\n3.3%317\n3.0%262\n2.2%318\nPhenytoin 7.4%312\n3.7%318\n2.9%316\n*Lamotrigine 5.4%319\n5.2%316\n3.2%318\n2.9%312\n2.2%320\n1.9%262\nGabapentin 4.1%321\nTopiramate 4.8%313\n4.3%322\n3.1%316\nLevetiracetam 0.7%323\n0.0%324\n*For lamotrigine, sodium valproate and carbamazepine montherapies, there is evidence to suggest that there is an\nincreased risk of teratogenicity associated with an increased dose.318, 325, 326\nAt present there is insufficient evidence on which to base advice about the teratogenic risks associated\nwith vigabatrin, ethosuximide, tiagabine, pregabalin, zonisamide, rufinamide, lacosamide and perampanel\nmonotherapy in pregnancy.\nSodium valproate\nThe teratogenic risk associated with sodium valproate is higher than with other AEDs both as mono- and\npolytherapy (see section 5.6.4).327 The teratogenic effect of sodium valproate is dose dependent and greatest\nfor daily doses >1,100 mg.325 High CM rates associated with prenatal sodium valproate exposure are more 2+\nlikely to be related to the total daily dose, rather than peak serum concentrations. Prescribing controlled 3\nrelease sodium valproate or administering it in multiple divided doses does not reduce the risk of congenital\nmalformations.314\n44 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 5 • Epilepsy and women’s health\nSafety advice from MHRA, issued in April 2018, on use of valproate medicines in women and girls of childbearing\npotential, states that valproate medicines must no longer be used in these groups unless there is no suitable\nalternative and the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met (see section 5.2.0).454\nD Women with epilepsy should be informed that sodium valproate is associated with a higher rate\nof teratogenicity compared to other antiepileptic drugs.\n Wherever possible sodium valproate should be avoided during pregnancy.\n For women of childbearing potential, particularly those women contemplating pregnancy, other\nantiepileptic drugs should be considered in preference to sodium valproate. However, sodium\nvalproate might be the only effective antiepileptic drug for some women, and this should not preclude\nits use.\n Given the morbidity and mortality risks associated with seizures (including sudden unexpected death\nin epilepsy) no antiepileptic drug should be discontinued during pregnancy unless this has been\ndiscussed with an epilepsy specialist.\nSpecific congenital malformations\nThe most common MCMs associated with established AEDs are neural tube defects (sodium valproate 3%,\ncarbamazepine 1%), cardiovascular defects, oral clefts and urinary tract defects.256, 259, 262, 308, 328 Carbamazepine\nteratogenicity appears to be relatively specific to fetal spina bifida, although the risks are lower than with\n2++\nsodium valproate.315 There is, however, conflicting evidence about this association.281 In 2011, the US Food 2+\nand Drug Administration issued a warning about the increased risk of orofacial clefts (lip and/or palate) 3\n4\nassociated with topiramate use in pregnancy,329 although limited evidence is available to confirm or refute\nthis association with studies arriving at different conclusions.313, 322, 330 Lamotrigine monotherapy does not\nappear to be associated with an increased risk of isolated orofacial clefts relative to other CMs.331\nAntiepileptic drug therapy in pregnancy also increases the risk of minor malformations including hypertelorism,\nepicanthic folds and digital hypoplasia.309 Monotherapy with sodium valproate and carbamazepine, but not\n2+\nphenytoin, clonazepam, lamotrigine or gabapentin, has been shown to be associated with a significant 3\nreduction in neonatal head circumference but not microcephaly (>2 standard deviations below mean head\ncircumference).332\nFetal anticonvulsant syndromes\nFetal anticonvulsant syndromes, comprising typical dysmorphic craniofacial appearances and a variety of\nmusculoskeletal abnormalities, have been described as associated with AED treatment in pregnancy.333-335 3\nAlthough individual drugs have been associated with specific patterns, there is overlap, and genetic factors 4\nmay influence susceptibility.335, 336\n5.6.4 RISKS TO THE FETUS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG POLYTHERAPY\nPolytherapy carries a much higher risk of MCM than monotherapy (see section 5.6.3) at up to 24% in women\ntaking four AEDs.252, 308-310, 312 Studies of polytherapies including sodium valproate have reported MCM rates of: 2+\n3\ny sodium valproate/lamotrigine polytherapy, 9.1%,337 9.6%,318 10.7%320\ny sodium valproate/carbamazepine polytherapy, 8.8%,318 10.7%.320\nDue to concerns about teratogenicity, safety advice issued by MHRA in April 2018 on use of valproate\nmedicines in women and girls of childbearing potential, states that valproate medicines must no longer be\nused in these groups unless there is no suitable alternative and the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention\nProgramme are met (see section 5.2.0).454\n2+\n3\n| 45\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nLamotrigine polytherapy regimens that do not contain sodium valproate are associated with a low rate of\nteratogenicity (2.8%,320 2.9%337).\n3\nAED polytherapy is more likely to result in microcephaly although evidence suggests this does not impact\non childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes at 3 years of age.338\nD Women with epilepsy should be informed that antiepileptic drug polytherapy regimens including\nsodium valproate are associated with higher rates of congenital malformations compared to\nregimens not including sodium valproate.\n Whenever possible, antiepileptic drug polytherapy regimens including sodium valproate should be\navoided in women of childbearing potential because of the increased risk of congenital malformations.\n5.6.5 RECURRENCE RISK OF CONGENITAL MALFORMATION\nThe risk of CM in women with epilepsy without a history of CM is 9.8%. This risk increases to 16.8–35.7% if there\nis history in a previous child, and 50% if two previous children have been affected. There is a trend for risks to\n3\nbe higher for women exposed to sodium valproate and topiramate, but not other monotherapies. Risks are\nalso higher for polytherapy regimens where the AED dose had been increased after the first pregnancy.339, 340\n Any woman with epilepsy who has given birth to a child with a congenital malformation while taking\nan antiepileptic drug should be offered review by an obstetrician and an epilepsy specialist before\nany future pregnancy.\n5.6.6 PERINATAL OUTCOMES\nThe majority of women with epilepsy will deliver a healthy baby at term. There is, however, some evidence\nthat epilepsy may be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, particularly for women taking AEDs.\nEvidence to determine whether or not epilepsy is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth and neonatal\ndeath is limited, although a systematic review concluded that there is probably no substantially increased\nrisk of perinatal mortality in the offspring of women with epilepsy.341 A large Danish study found no overall\nassociation between the use of AEDs during pregnancy and spontaneous miscarriage or stillbirth, although\nthe statistical precision of the latter was low.342\nIn women with epilepsy taking AEDs, the risk of having a small for gestational age (SGA) infant is double\nthe expected rate in the general obstetric population, but the impact of different AEDs is not known.\n282, 341, 343 There is insufficient evidence to support the use of routine ultrasound scanning in the third trimester\n2++\nof pregnancy to detect a SGA fetus, however, if a SGA fetus is suspected clinically, an ultrasound scan should\nbe performed to assess fetal biometry. If an SGA fetus is identified in a women with epilepsy, AED use should\nbe considered as a potential aetiological factor.341\nThe offspring of women with epilepsy taking AEDs are twice as likely as expected to have a 1 minute Apgar\nscore of <7.282 341\nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude whether or not the offspring of women with epilepsy are at increased\nrisk of respiratory distress, intrauterine growth restriction and neontatal intensive care unit admission.341\nFurther research is required to provide definitive information on perinatal outcomes for women with epilepsy\ntaking antiepileptic drugs, particularly perinatal outcomes for specific antiepileptic drugs.\nC Women with epilepsy should be reassured that antiepileptic drugs do not increase the risk of\nspontaneous miscarriage and stillbirth\n46 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 5 • Epilepsy and women’s health\n5.6.7 CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES\n3 There is no evidence that untreated maternal epilepsy is associated with impaired cognitive development 2++\nin offspring.341, 344\n2+\nThere is, however, evidence to suggest that the offspring of women with epilepsy receiving AEDs are at\nincreased risk of poor cognitive outcome although evidence about which AEDs increase the risk is inconsistent.\nSome studies suggest that carbamazepine monotherapy does not increase the risk of poor cognitive outcomes\ncompared to unexposed controls but that sodium valproate, phenytoin and phenobarbital monotherapy are\n2++\nassociated with an increased risk.265, 341, 345 A prospective multicentre study assessing intelligence quotient (IQ)\nat six years of age in 224 children born to women taking carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin or sodium\nvalproate monotherapy, reported that IQ was significantly lower after exposure to sodium valproate (with\na dose-dependent relationship) than to the other AEDs, with verbal and memory abilities being particular\nproblems (see section 5.2.1).265\nOther adverse outcomes that have been linked to AEDs include childhood verbal language impairment\nassociated with fetal exposure to sodium valproate,346 impaired neurodevelopment in infants exposed to\n3 2++\nsodium valproate or carbamazepine but not lamotrigine,347 and autism spectrum disorder and childhood\n3\nautism in children exposed to sodium valproate prenatally.345 There is, however, insufficient evidence to make\nrecommendations about treatment with any specific AED or combination of AEDs.\nDue to concerns about teratogenicity, safety advice issued by MHRA in April 2018 on use of valproate\nmedicines in women and girls of childbearing potential, states that valproate medicines must no longer be\nused in these groups unless there is no suitable alternative and the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention\nProgramme are met (see section 5.2.0).454\n For women with epilepsy who require treatment with antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy the\nrelative risks of seizures and risks of fetal, neonatal and childhood problems should be discussed.\n Consideration may be given to withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs prior to conception if circumstances\nare favourable. The decision should only be made if the epilepsy is in remission, the risk of recurrent\nseizures is low and the woman is aware of the consequences of recurrent seizures.\n Wherever possible, a woman should conceive on the lowest effective dose of one AED appropriate\nfor her epilepsy syndrome. If she has good seizure control and presents already pregnant, there is\nprobably little to be gained by altering her AEDs\n2++\n5.7 POSTPARTUM ADVICE FOR MOTHERS\nFollowing delivery, physiological changes associated with pregnancy gradually remit and blood levels of\nAEDs may rise. If AED dosing was increased in pregnancy, this may lead to toxicity postpartum and dosing\nmay need to be reduced at this time.\nCaring for a young baby is often associated with fatigue and sleep deprivation, both of which can provoke\nseizures. Evidence suggests that the first three days after delivery are associated with a higher risk of seizures.286\nAlthough injuries to infants from maternal seizures are thought to be uncommon, babies of women with 3\nepilepsy, especially mothers with myoclonic epilepsies, are at risk. Bathing infants is potentially hazardous\nif the mother has seizures associated with loss of awareness.\nThe postnatal check provides an opportunity to examine the infant for any abnormality.\n All pregnant women with epilepsy should be encouraged to plan ahead before the birth of their\nchild.\n| 47\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n Where seizure control is poor and/or social factors have the potential to affect outcomes adversely,\na care management plan should be considered before delivery. It should be ensured that health\nprofessionals, both in the community and in secondary care, are aware of the potential risks to the\nwoman and her baby.\n Advice should be given to new parents/child carers on safety, particularly in relation to breastfeeding\nand caring for the child.\n After the birth a review of the mother’s AED therapy should be undertaken.\n Advice regarding contraception, the need for planning future pregnancies, folic acid requirements\nand risks associated with AEDs in pregnancy should be offered at the postnatal visit.\n Extra support should be available to mothers who have a physical or learning disability.\n5.7.1 POSTPARTUM CONTRACEPTION\nPostpartum contraceptive advice helps women to plan future pregnancies,348 and reliable contraception\nshould be discussed early in the postpartum period (see section 5.1). Interpregnancy intervals of less than six\nmonths have been associated with an increased risk of negative perinatal outcomes.349 Short interpregnancy 4\nintervals also increase the risks to maternal health,350 therefore, delaying future pregnancies may be beneficial\nin terms of health.\n As with all women following delivery, timely advice should be given to those with epilepsy regarding\ncontraception.\n Progesterone-only oral contraception, which is often the contraceptive method of choice in women\nwho are breastfeeding, is contraindicated postpartum in women with epilepsy taking hepatic enzyme-\ninducing AEDs as these increase progesterone metabolism.\n5.8 ADVICE ABOUT BREASTFEEDING\nAED plasma concentrations in infants who are breastfed are generally lower than in utero, provided the\ninfant is healthy and born close to term.290, 296, 351-353 Although AEDs pass into breast milk at varying levels\nthere is no consistent evidence to show accumulation of any AED in breastfed newborn of women with\nepilepsy. Data suggest probable penetration into breast milk of primidone and levetiracetam in amounts\nthat may be clinically important, possible penetration of gabapentin, lamotrigine and topiramate, and\nprobably no penetration, in clinically important amounts, of sodium valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin 3\nand carbamazepine.266 Breastfeeding and subsequent weaning usually allow for a gradual withdrawal with\nusually no adverse sequelae for the infant.354-356\nAccumulation of AEDs may occur due to immature mechanisms for drug elimination and, therefore, close\nmonitoring is recommended, particulaly if the baby is preterm, jaundiced, or if the mother started taking\nAEDs late in pregnancy or after delivery.357 There may also be a risk of toxicity in the breastfed infant if the\nmother is on a high dose of AEDs or polytherapy. Parents should be made aware of signs of toxicity in the\ninfant and encouraged to seek medical advice if these occur.357\n All mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed and receive support from their health visitor, midwife\nand GP.\nD Parents should be made aware of signs of toxicity in infants of breastfeeding women taking\nantiepileptic drugs. The possibility of sedation should be considered in infants of mothers taking\nhigh dose antiepileptic drugs, polytherapy, or regimens including primidone, levetiracetam,\ngabapentin, lamotrigine and topiramate.\n48 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 6 • Psychiatric comorbidity\n5.9 MENOPAUSE AND EPILEPSY\nInformation about the effects of the menopause on epilepsy is limited. In one study in 68 women with\nepilepsy, menopause occurred 3–4 years earlier in patients with more than one seizure a month independent\n1+\nof other factors.358 There is some evidence to suggest that seizure frequency may alter in perimenopausal\n2+\nwomen, perhaps due to changing oestrogen concentrations,359 and some women experience an increase 3\nin seizure frequency at this time.360, 361 Bone disease associated with epilepsy becomes an important issue\nafter the menopause (see section 4.6.4).145, 362\nData regarding hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and seizures are conflicting. HRT may improve seizure\ncontrol in those who previously experienced catamenial epilepsy (seizures with menstruation) but could\nbe associated with increased seizure frequency in others.361, 363 One small study found HRT containing the 1++\n2+\ncombination of conjugated equine oestrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate was associated with\n3\nworsening seizures and a reduction in lamotrigine concentrations.364\nEnzyme-inducing AEDs (see Table 3) reduce the efficacy of standard doses of HRT.213\nFurther research on the menopause in women with epilepsy is required.\nD Women should be aware that their seizure pattern may change around the menopause.\n4\nD Hormone replacement therapy should be prescribed for the same indications as in women who\ndo not have epilepsy.\n3\n| 49\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n6 Psychiatric comorbidity\nPsychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy are common but may go undiagnosed and untreated.\nSeveral large epidemiological studies have reported increased rates of psychiatric comorbidity in people with\nepilepsy compared to the general population,365, 366 and compared to patients with other chronic conditions\nsuch as asthma, with one reporting a rate of depression of 36.5% for people with epilepsy, compared to\n27.8% for patients with chronic asthma and 11.6% in the control group.367\nMajor depression is the main psychiatric comorbidity in people with epilepsy with rates of 24% recorded.368\nThis represents a significant additional burden to patients, their families and the healthcare system with\npeople with depression more likely to access healthcare resources.369 One study showed that up to 38% of\npatients with a lifetime history of major depression had never received treatment and another showed a\n10-fold increase in detection of depression in their seizure clinic after the introduction of regular screening\nwith the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E) (see section 6.1.1).370 Up to a fifth\nof people with epilepsy also have an anxiety disorder,371 resulting in reduced measures of self efficacy and\nquality of life.372, 373\nSuicide rates in people with epilepsy three times higher than those seen in the general population have been\nreported,374 with one study reporting that suicide was 13 times more common in patients with epilepsy who\nalso had a comorbid psychiatric condition.374 This finding is supported by a large hospital-based study of\nover 9,000 people with epilepsy that reported a Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) in people with epilepsy\nof 3.5 (95% CI 2.6 to 4.6).375\nPsychosis in people with epilepsy can present as a chronic condition or be episodic in nature, having a direct\nrelationship to seizures. A recent systematic review established that as many as 6% of patients will have a\ncomorbid psychotic illness, although this can rise to 7% in people with temporal lobe epilepsy.376 This study\nsupports the findings of an earlier large epidemiological study.377 The additional burden of episodic psychosis\ncannot be underestimated with patients suffering sadness, embarrassment and confusion about the events\nwhich may have taken place during the psychotic episode.\nThere remains an innate tension between the gold standard of assessment with structured psychiatric\ndiagnostic interviews conducted by appropriately trained mental health professionals and the need for\nhealthcare professionals to have access to screening tools which are valid, reliable and easily administered in\nbusy clinical areas. Identification of patients with epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric conditions is, however,\nimportant and suitable screening tools should be deployed in all epilepsy clinics.378\n6.1 SCREENING\nScreening tools to establish the presence of depression, anxiety and suicidality in people with epilepsy are,\nin general, the same as those for the general population.\nScreening tools for healthcare professionals need to be easily administered and sensitive to treatment effects\nin order to measure psychiatric comorbidity in people with epilepsy.\n6.1.1 DEPRESSION\nThe NDDI-E is a self-rating tool with six questions and easily understood scoring specifically designed for,\ntrialled and validated in people with epilepsy. It does not appear to be affected by drug adverse effects,\nunlike other measures.378\nOther general screening tools include the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2) (two questions),379 the\nHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Depression subscale (HADS-D), the Beck’s Depression Inventory\n(BDI-II) (21 questions), the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (20 questions) and the Distress\nThermometer, a single-item visual analogue scale designed to measure subjective distress in the past week.380\n50 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 6 • Psychiatric comorbidity\nDirect comparison of the NDDI-E with the PHQ-2 showed little difference in sensitivity and specificity at\ndetecting depression.366 Further comparison between NDDI-E and HADS-D has shown that the NDDI-E may\nbe superior when eliciting the presence of Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview defined moderate\nto high suicide risk compared with the HADS-D scale >8.368\nComparison of the Distress Thermometer, the NDDI-E, HADS-D, and BDI-II using the World Health Organisation 3\n(WHO) Major Depression Inventory to identify depression as defined by DSM-IV and ICD-10 suggests that\nthey are similar in their ability to rule out the presence of depression. There was no difference in diagnostic\naccuracy and no evidence that one is superior to another, but in the interests of brevity either the NDDI-E\nor HADS-D should be considered. In patients where literacy cannot be assumed, visual analogue scales like\nthe Distress Thermometer should be considered.381\n6.1.2 ANXIETY\nNo screening tools designed specifically to measure anxiety in patients with epilepsy were found. In the\nabsence of such tools, the HADS and General Anxiety Disorder 7 can be considered although these have\nnot been validated in people with epilepsy.371\n6.1.3 PSYCHOSIS\nNo tools were found for screening psychosis in patients with epilepsy.\n6.1.4 SUICIDALITY\nGiven that suicidality is significantly raised in people with epilepsy, screening tools are needed that can identify\nthis risk. The NDDI-E has been shown to have a higher sensitivity than the HADS-D at identifying suicidal\n3\nideation (81% v 43%), although its specificity was lower (66 % v 91%); it should, therefore, be considered as\nsuperior to the HADS-D as a screening measure for severe depression and suicidal ideation.368\n6.1.5 LEARNING DISABILITY\nNo screening tools specifically for use in patients with a learning disability and epilepsy were found. As rates\nof psychiatric comorbidity in patients with a learning disability are high,382 and assessment in this population\nrequires specific instruments, the Glasgow Anxiety Scale and the Glasgow Depression Scale for People with\nLearning Disability (GDS-LD),383, 384 both designed for use with those with mild to moderate learning disability,\ncould be considered, although these are not specifically validated in people with epilepsy.\n6.1.6 FUTURE RESEARCH\nFuture research into the effectiveness of screening for psychiatric comorbidity in patients with epilepsy should\ninclude broad-ranging general population studies, to reduce the risk of heterogeneity, and these should\ninclude the full spectrum of people with epilepsy. Standard definitions and measures should be employed.\nThe gold standard of structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews in studies evaluating screening tools is\nrequired to fully investigate their sensitivity and specificity for detecting the presence of the full range of\npsychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy.371\nFuture studies should be mindful of the specific cognitive deficits people with epilepsy experience, such as\nreduced concentration, increased memory difficulties and fatigue alongside disturbance in sleep, as these\noverlap with many somatic symptoms of depression and could act as confounders.\nD Screening for depression and suicidality should be considered in all patients with epilepsy.\nD The NDDI-E, HADS-D, BDI-II or PHQ-2 can all be used to screen for depression in adults with depression\nand epilepsy. The NDDI-E may be superior for detecting severe depression and suicidal ideation.\n When screening identifies the presence of possible psychiatric comorbidity, people with epilepsy\nshould be referred to an appropriately trained mental healthcare professional for further assessment\nand, where relevant, treatment.\n| 51\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n Screening tools used by non-mental healthcare professionals should be brief, easily administered\nand easily understood.\n Although not specifically validated for use in epilepsy, consideration should be given to using screening\ntools such as the Glasgow Anxiety Scale or the Glasgow Depression Scale for People with Learning\nDisability in patients with intellectual disability.\n Assessment of anxiety and depression should, where relevant, be considered as part of a\nmultidisciplinary approach to patient-centred care.\n6.2 TREATMENT OPTIONS\nEvidence for treatment options for the management of psychiatric comorbidity in people with epilepsy is\nlimited to the management of depression and anxiety, the prevalence of both of which are high in patients 2+\nwith epilepsy (see section 6),371 often underdiagnosed and undertreated partly due to healthcare professionals’ 3\nconcerns regarding possible negative effects of psychotropic medication.385\nComorbid depression in people with epilepsy is associated with poor seizure control,386,387,388 increased\nhealthcare costs,369 and with a greater impact on quality of life than the number of prescribed antiepileptic\ndrugs or seizure frequency.389, 390\n Treatment of anxiety and depression should, where relevant, be considered as part of a multidisciplinary\napproach to patient-centred care.\n6.2.1 NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT\nTwo systematic reviews provide some evidence of benefit for cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in the\ntreatment of depression in people with epilepsy, but conflicting results and methodological limitations\nof the included studies, and the small numbers of patients included in the trials, limit the conclusions that 1++\ncan be drawn.159, 385 One review reported benefit from CBT in three out of six RCTs, with benefit confined to 2++\nRCTs where the CBT was specifically tailored to improve depression rather than seizure control.385 There is,\nhowever, insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation.\n6.2.2 PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION\nNo convincing evidence was identified that showed the relative efficacy of antidepressants for the treatment\n2-\nof depression in people with epilepsy.391, 392\nAntidepressants, in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, appear to be safe to use in patients 2+\n3\nwith epilepsy and comorbid depression.391, 393-395\nAntidepressants are effective in the treatment of depression in people with chronic illness including\nneurological disorders,396 and it is reasonable to extrapolate these findings to patients with epilepsy as the\nissues of comorbidity, confounding and variable disease course are similar. Studies looking specifically at the 1+\ntreatment of depression in patients with epilepsy are limited to observational studies, often of low quality\nand in highly selected populations in single, generally tertiary, centres and with varying definitions and\ndegrees of depression, making comparison difficult.\nA recent review of the possible association between the use of AEDs and suicide concluded that there was\nno clear evidence to confirm or rule out an association because of heterogeneity in the included studies at\n2++\nthe clinical and the methodological level. Most of the studies considered the effect of AEDs as a single class\neffect and this assumption may need to be revisited in light of the different effects of the different AEDs on\nmood (see section 4.6.5).397\nD Treatment with antidepressants should be considered in patients with epilepsy and comorbid\ndepression.\n52 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 6 • Psychiatric comorbidity\n6.2.3 COGNITIVE REHABILITATION\nCognitive problems in people with epilepsy commonly involve learning, memory and executive function\n(impulsivity, planning and organisation, and multitasking). In one study of 700 patients with epilepsy, 54%\n2+\nreported memory problems,398 although it is not known how this compares with the general adult population.\n3\nEpilepsy-specific memory deficits including ‘accelerated forgetting’, remote memory impairments and\ntransient epileptic amnesia have also been reported.399, 400\nMemory and attention problems can be identified using cognitive screening tools such as the Addenbrook’s\nCognitive Assessment (third version), although these are not specific to patients with epilepsy.211 When\nmore in-depth neuropsychological assessment is required, this should be provided by a suitably qualified\nclinical psychologist specialising in neuropsychology. There is no agreement on which measures to use to\ninvestigate the effects of cognitive rehabilitation in epilepsy.\nCognitive rehabilitation through compensation strategy training (where people are taught to use aids,\n2+\nprompts and methods to help them augment their cognitive abilities) and the retraining method (which\n3\naims to develop more cognitive facility and capacity by viewing memory as a muscle which can be built up\nand improved) with some form of support or psychoeducation regarding the nature of memory problems\nimplicit in the rehabilitation, have been investigated. A comparison of the effects of a cognitive retraining 1-\nmethod with a compensatory training method to treat attention problems in a small group of people with\nfocal seizures receiving monotherapy (n=44 completing follow-up assessments), reported improvements\nin self-reported quality of life measures in both treatment groups, compared to the control group, at six\nmonths follow up. The compensation method was the more effective of the two approaches, particularly\nto those with less education.401\nCognitive rehabilitation may also benefit some patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. One study in\n57 patients reported that patients with right temporal lobe epilepsy with verbal memory problems appeared\nto respond well to cognitive rehabilitation, whereas effects were limited for those with left temporal lobe 2+\nepilepsy. Further research is needed on what types of training help which patients and when it should be\n1++\noffered.402\n2++\nCognition in epilepsy may be helped by cognitive rehabilitation and there are no adverse effects of the\ntreatment. There is, however, currently insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation.\n Centres and researchers studying cognition in epilepsy, and the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation\non memory and other cognitive deficits in epilepsy, should use comparable measures and assessments.\n2-\n Cognitive rehabilitation and psychoeducation should be part of multidisciplinary care for people\nwith epilepsy.\n2+\n3\n Memory problems can be distressing and/or disabling and should, in the first instance, be identified\nby a cognitive screen. There should be access to specialist neuropsychological opinion and advice,\nas deemed appropriate by the multidisciplinary team.\n1+\n2++\n| 53\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n7 Sleep\nSleep and epilepsy have reciprocal interactions: on the one hand, sleep (and sleep deprivation) can be a trigger\nfor seizure onset in some forms of epilepsy; on the other, epileptic seizures and antiepileptic drugs disrupt\nnormal sleep, contributing to the morbidity of epilepsy.403 Distinguishing non-epileptic sleep disorders (such\nas parasomnias) from seizures may also present particular difficulties and may require specialist investigation\n(see section 3.4.4).403\nOther relationships between sleep and epilepsy have gained attention in recent years, notably the possible\ninteraction between obstructive sleep apnoea and epilepsy, and the importance of nocturnal seizures in\nSUDEP.\n7.1 SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND SLEEP HYGIENE\nObservational data suggest that sleep deprivation can precipitate seizures in people with epilepsy, as well\nas activating underlying EEG abnormalities.404 This effect is most marked in the genetic epilepsy syndromes,\nand is less clear in focal epilepsies.405\n People with epilepsy, particularly those with a genetic epilepsy, should be advised that sleep\ndeprivation may precipitate seizures, and be provided with advice to obtain sufficient sleep with a\nregular sleep/wake pattern.\n7.2 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNOEA AND EPILEPSY\nIt has been suggested that people with treatment-resistant epilepsy are at increased risk of developing\nobstructive sleep apnoea (OSA),405, 406 and that treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure 2-\n(CPAP) may improve seizure frequency.407, 408\nOSA is characterized by impaired breathing during sleep, and affected individuals usually report excessive\ndaytime sleepiness, loud snoring, and often witnessed breathing pauses. It is known to cause daytime fatigue,\nsleepiness and cognitive problems and it is possible that recognition and timely management of OSA may\nimprove seizure control, cognitive function and quality of life in people with treatment-resistant epilepsy.\nDefinitive evidence of either an increased prevalence of OSA in people with epilepsy, or a beneficial effect\non seizures from CPAP treatment in patients with OSA, is lacking and there is, therefore, insufficient evidence\nto recommend routine investigation for OSA in people with epilepsy in the absence of a clinically suggestive\nhistory.\n Healthcare professionals should enquire about the cardinal features of obstructive sleep apnoea in\nindividuals with treatment-resistant epilepsy, and refer them to specialist sleep services for further\nassessment if obstructive sleep apnoea is clinically suspected.\n7.3 SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH IN EPILEPSY AND SLEEP\nSudden unexpected death in epilepsy is discussed in detail in section 8. It is, however, highlighted here as\nobservational data suggest that individuals with frequent nocturnal convulsive seizures are at increased risk\nof SUDEP, with around 60% of cases of SUDEP occurring during sleep.409\n Individuals with nocturnal seizures should be counselled about the increased risk of sudden\nunexpected death in epilepsy as part of counselling about the risks of epilepsy and preventative\nmeasures (particularly adherence with antiepileptic drug treatment).\n54 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 8 • Mortality\n8 Mortality\nStudies from around the world report premature death in adults with epilepsy compared to the general\npopulation, with standardised mortality ratios of 3–5 having been reported.375, 410-412 The majority of these\ndeaths occur in people under 55 years of age.375, 413 A total population study from Scandanavia reported a\nmedian age of death of 34.5 years (interquartile range 21–44 years) with an adjusted OR of 11.0 for premature\ndeath in people with epilepsy compared with an unaffected sibling and an age-matched control.413\nPremature death in epilepsy has a wide variety of causes including alcohol misuse (SMR 24.6, 96% CI 21.0 to\n28.6),375 drowning (OR 7.7, 95% CI 4.7 to 12.7), falls (OR 8.8, 95% CI 5.3 to 13.7), drug poisoning (OR 5.1, 95%\nCI 3.9 to 6.5) and motor vehicle accidents (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8).413\nAnother significant cause of premature mortality is suicide. A population based study of suicide in epilepsy\nreported a suicide rate in people with epilepsy three times higher than in the general population, with rates\nincreased further in people with epilepsy who had a comorbid psychiatric condition (see section 6).374\n8.1 SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH IN EPILEPSY\nOf all the causes of premature mortality in people with epilepsy, SUDEP commands the most attention\nbecause of its sudden appearance and devastating aftermath. SUDEP is defined as sudden, unexpected,\nunwitnessed, non-traumatic, non-drowning death of a person with epilepsy, with or without a seizure,\nexcluding documented status epilepticus, and in whom post mortem examination does not reveal a structural\nor toxicological cause of death.414 The definition is descriptive, providing no insight into the possible causes\nof the phenomenon.\nThe reported incidence of SUDEP depends on the populations studied and the study methodology.415, 416\n2-\nCommunity-based studies in unselected cohorts of incident cases of epilepsy have the lowest risk of bias\nand give incidences of between 0.09 and 0.35/1,000 patient years.415 Studies in prevalent populations give\nincidences of between 0.9 and 2.3/1,000 patient years,415 while estimates in patients awaiting epilepsy surgery\nare higher at 6.3 to 9.3/1,000 patient years.417, 418\n8.1.1 RISK FACTORS\nSeizure type and frequency\nGeneralised tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) are the principal risk factor for SUDEP, with studies demonstrating\n1++\nincreased risk in individuals who sustained frequent GTCS.419 420-423 A meta-analysis of 112 RCTs provides 1+\nfurther evidence for the role of GTCS, reporting fewer deaths from SUDEP in the active treatment group.424 2+\n3\nEye-witness reports and coroners studies also confirm that SUDEP is a seizure related phenomenon.425-427\nThere is some evidence from direct observation of SUDEP in video-EEG units and from case reports that\nSUDEP is more likely to occur during GTCS sustained in sleep.425-427\n3\nFurther evidence for seizure as the principal risk factor is evidenced by the observation that patients who\nundergo successful epilepsy surgery, compared to those whose seizures continue, have SMRs similar to the\nbackground population.428\nEarly identification of treatment-resistant epilepsy (see section 4.3) and referral for assessment for epilepsy\nsurgery (see section 4.9) to reduce seizure frequency may reduce incidence of SUDEP.\nAntiepileptic drug treatment\n2++\nThere is no convincing evidence that SUDEP is caused by any single or combination of AEDs.423, 426, 429\n3\n| 55\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nAdherence\nA large study of healthcare providers’ databases in the USA reported an association between poor adherence\nand increased mortality.430 Post mortem studies, usually involving small numbers of individuals, have reported\n3\nsubtherapeutic AED levels in some cases of SUDEP suggesting poor adherence to AED treatment.431, 432 One\nstudy using post mortem hair analysis demonstated that discontinuation of AED treatment by patients\nappeared to increase the risk of SUDEP.433\nOther risk factors\nEarly age of onset of epilepsy, AED polytherapy, concomitant psychotropic medication, and sleeping alone\n2++\nhave been reported as risk factors for SUDEP.416, 434, 435 These findings, however, are not consistent. One study,\n2+\nfor example, showed that the association with AED polytherapy disappeared when GTCS frequency was 4\ntaken into account.423\nB Healthcare professionals and patients should aim for complete seizure freedom to reduce the risk\nof sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.\nD Adherence to the prescribed antiepileptic drug regime should be strongly encouraged and the\npatient asked to report any adverse effects that might compromise adherence in order to reduce\nthe risk of increased mortality and morbidity.\n Patients with active seizures, ie who have sustained seizures, and in particular generalised tonic-clonic\nseizures, in the past year, should be assessed by a specialist physician and epilepsy nurse specialist.\n The apparent increase in SUDEP in people with frequent nocturnal seizures should be highlighted to\npatients and nocturnal supervision could be considered.\n • Patients admitted to video-EEG units who will have their antiepileptic drugs reduced must be\nwarned of the risk of SUDEP, although the risk is low.\ny It is desirable that video-EEG units should monitor oxygen saturation levels as well as ECG and EEG.\ny Video-EEG units must have adequate staff levels to respond immediately should the patient\nbecome apnoic or exhibit a significant cardiac arrhythmia.\n8.1.2 MECHANISMS OF SUDEP\nThe mechanisms underlying SUDEP are not yet well understood,435 and until they are, definitive advice about\nthe role of seizure alarm systems, lattice pillows and avoiding the prone position during sleep, cannot be given.\nOne study reporting 16 directly observed cases of SUDEP (14 of which occurred at night) observed worldwide\nin video-EEG units reported that deaths occurred after a GTCS usually during sleep.427 The immediate postictal\n3\nphase was accompanied by rapid breathing, bradycardia or tachycardia, followed by terminal apnoea and\nasystole. The authors concluded that SUDEP occurs after GTCS because of a severe central disruption of\ncardiac and respiratory function.\nDiscussion of this and other proposed mechanisms for SUDEP is beyond the scope of this guideline.\n8.1.3 COUNSELLING PATIENTS ABOUT THE RISKS OF SUDEP\nA study of patients with epilepsy in the 16–30 age group suggested that the majority want information about\nSUDEP and that they prefer to receive this information face-to-face in the clinic rather than by leaflet. SUDEP\n3\ndisclosure may cause initial anxiety but there is no evidence that this is long lasting. There is no compelling\nevidence that knowledge of SUDEP improves adherence to treatment.436, 437\nD Counselling about the risks of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy should be considered for\npatients with epilepsy at an appropriate time for the patient and by an appropriate healthcare\nprofessional (consultant neurologist, physician with an interest in epilepsy, specialist registrar, or\nepilepsy nurse specialist).\n56 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 9 • Models of care\n9 Models of care\n3\nThe care of people with epilepsy is provided in primary (principally general practice-based), and secondary\nand tertiary (hospital-based) settings. Although there is no single accepted model of care for patients with\nepilepsy, co-ordination of care between these two settings and the involvement of epilepsy specialists from\na range of disciplines is likely to result in the best overall care for the patient.\nA survey of patients’ perspectives on services for epilepsy reported that, “...most people with epilepsy (67.6%)\n2++ would prefer their care to be community based, especially older patients and patients with mild epilepsy”.438\n3\n2+\nA further study also showed that, “...61% of patients would prefer their care to be shared between primary\n4\nand secondary services”.439\n9.1 MODELS OF PRIMARY CARE FOR EPILEPSY\nThe primary-care needs of patients with epilepsy were well stated in a UK epilepsy needs document\nincluding the suggestion of an annual structured review, as was recommended for other chronic diseases\n3\nsuch as asthma and diabetes.440 Implementation of such management in primary care would be facilitated\nby the deployment of specialist epilepsy nurses, who can liaise between primary care and hospital care, and\npromote a shared care model.438\nPrimary-care professionals are gatekeepers to secondary-care access and co-operative evidence-based\ncare shared between epilepsy-care providers is likely to enhance patient care. Patients with epilepsy who\nare seizure free on therapy and discharged from hospital review still have significant healthcare needs and\nrequire regular structured review in primary care to have these needs met.\nA prospective audit to measure unmet clinical needs in 388 patients receiving treatment for epilepsy found a\nsignificant increase in the annual review rate and documentation of seizure frequency following introduction\n3\nof the Quality Outcomes Framework GP contract for epilepsy in 2004 (now retired), but also showed that\n48% of the 62 patients with poor control were not receiving shared care.441\nPatients with suspected first seizure or epilepsy should be referred to a specialist in epilepsy and should be\nadvised to take an eyewitness (to the attack) or contact details of someone who witnessed the attack to 4\ntheir consultation (see sections 3.1 and 3.3).442\n9.1.1 REGULAR STRUCTURED REVIEW\nRegular structured review in primary care is an opportunity to ensure optimum management of patients\nwith epilepsy and should be conducted by a healthcare professional who has “...attended an epilepsy\n4\ntraining course in the past five years, or can demonstrate equivalent experience from continuing professional\n3 development”.442 In the view of the guideline development group, the review should be conducted annually\nand include questions about:\ny seizure frequency\ny date of last seizure\ny focal seizures where appropriate\ny AED dose\ny AED adherence\ny AED adverse effects\n3\ny coexistent low mood or depression\ny driving status\ny alcohol intake.\nSeizure frequency and the date of a patient’s last seizure reflect the degree of seizure control. Where seizures\npersist despite AED treatment, factors relating to poor control including incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy,\ninappropriate choice of AED for the epilepsy syndrome, and poor adherence to prescribed AEDs, should be\n| 57\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nexplored and referral to an epilepsy specialist considered (see section 3 and section 4.3). Seizures are also a\nrisk factor for SUDEP and the goal should be seizure freedom (see section 8).\nWomen of childbearing potential who are taking AEDs require specific information about contraception,\nconception and pregnancy and may require specialist review, in secondary care, of their diagnosis and\ntreatment, prior to conception (see section 5).\nAdverse effects of AED treatment are common and sometimes serious (see section 4.6) and may contribute to\npoor adherence and poor control (see section 4.3). It is therefore important to give the patient the opportunity\nto discuss these at their regular review.\nThe management of people with a learning disability and epilepsy is covered in section 4.15.\nHigh rates of psychiatric comorbidity and increased risk of suicide compared to the general population have\nbeen reported in people with epilepsy along with quality of life issues relating to the epilepsy (see section 6).\nRegular structured review in primary care provides an opportunity to identify such problems and provide\npatients with help and support where appropriate.\nEpileptic attacks are the most frequent medical cause of collapse at the wheel and therefore have important\nimplications for fitness to drive.154 There is also some evidence that patients with seizure-free intervals of 12\nmonths or more have substantially reduced odds of car accidents compared to patients with shorter seizure-\nfree intervals.443 This reinforces the need to attain good seizure control and to discuss with the patient the 3\n4\npossible implications of driving with poorly-controlled seizures. Current guidance is that patients referred\nfollowing a suspected first seizure or new epilepsy should be advised not to drive until they have seen an\nepilepsy specialist,154, 442 and patients with established epilepsy who have had a seizure in the last year should\nbe informed of current DVLA regulations.154\nAntiepileptic drug use is associated with a higher risk of clinical fracture and patients with epilepsy taking\nAEDs should therefore be given diet and lifestyle advice to reduce osteoporosis risk (see section 4.6.4).\nProvoked seizures may be related to intake or withdrawal of certain drugs or alcohol (see sections 4.5 and\n4.12) and, where appropriate, this possibility should be discussed with the patient.\nWithdrawal of AED treatment may be an option for patients on AEDs who have been seizure free for at least\ntwo years and such patients should be given the opportunity to discuss possible AED withdrawal with an\nepilepsy specialist (see section 4.7).\nD A structured management system for patients with epilepsy should be established in primary\ncare. As with other chronic diseases, an annual review is desirable.\nD The annual review should be facilitated by specialist epilepsy nurses, linking primary care to the\nhospital system (shared care).\nD The shared care management system adopted should seek to:\ny identify all patients with epilepsy, register/record basic demographic data, validate the\nclassification of seizures and syndromes\ny make the provisional diagnosis in new patients, provide appropriate information and refer\nthe patient to a specialist centre\ny monitor seizures, aiming to improve control by adjustment of medication or re-referral to\nhospital services\ny minimise the adverse effects of medications and their interactions\ny facilitate structured withdrawal from medication where appropriate, and if agreed by the\npatient\ny introduce non-clinical interventions, and disseminate information to help improve the quality\nof life for patients with epilepsy\ny address specific women’s issues, and\ny address the needs of patients with learning disabilities.\n58 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 9 • Models of care\nD Healthcare professionals who carry out structured primary-care reviews for patients with epilepsy\nshould have attended an epilepsy training course in the past five years or be able to demonstrate\nequivalent experience from continuing professional development.\nD Patients presenting to primary care with suspected first seizure or new epilepsy should be referred\nto an epilepsy specialist and asked to take an eyewitness or eyewitness contact details if available,\nto the appointment.\nD Patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy should have the opportunity to receive shared care to\nenable accurate classification and tailored management of their seizures.\nD Women of childbearing potential who are taking antiepileptic drugs should receive information\nabout contraception, conception and pregnancy at their regular structured review in primary\ncare and should have the opportunity to be referred to secondary care to have their diagnosis\nand treatment reviewed by specialist services before conception.\nD Patients referred following a suspected first seizure or new epilepsy should be advised not to drive\nuntil they have seen an epilepsy specialist.\n3\nD Patients with epilepsy who hold a driving licence and who continue to have seizures should be\n4\nmade aware of current DVLA regulations.\n All patients with epilepsy should receive an annual review within primary care which should be\nconducted face-to-face and should include questions on:\ny seizure control, seizure frequency and date of last seizure\ny antiepileptic drug dose, adherence and adverse effects\ny mood and anxiety\ny diet and lifestyle advice to reduce osteoporosis risk\ny alcohol consumption.\n Healthcare professionals, at all levels, should be aware of the valuable contribution which can be\nmade by the voluntary sector and should be proactive in highlighting the benefits of, and willing to\nsignpost patients to, voluntary services for support and information.\n9.2 MODELS OF SECONDARY AND TERTIARY CARE FOR EPILEPSY\nNo clear evidence was found to support any particular model of secondary or tertiary care for patients with\nepilepsy. A systematic review comparing specialist epilepsy clinics with general neurology clinics found\ninsufficient evidence to demonstrate the superiority of any particular care model.444 The authors concluded,\nhowever, that the failure to find an effect may be due to the poor quality of the information available and\n2+\nlack of adequate research, rather than a lack of effect of specialist clinics on outcomes. A retrospective cohort\nstudy of 200 patients in the USA found that subspeciality care improved seizure control in patients with\ndrug-resistant epilepsy but concluded that further research is required to determine whether patients with\ndrug-resistant epilepsy would benefit from routine referral to an epilepsy specialist.445\nOn the basis of evidence provided elsewhere in this guideline, the guideline development group have\nproposed the following core components of different types of service.\n| 59\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\nTable 7: Core components for epilepsy services in secondary and tertiary care\nService type Requirements\nDistrict general hospital without neurology Access to medical and nursing epilepsy specialists\noutpatient services for acute and complex cases\nAccess to EEG for emergency management of\nstatus epilepticus\nTeaching hospital or hospital with a neurology unit Specialist epilepsy clinics\nand outpatient neurology services\nEpilepsy medical and nursing specialists\nAccess to specialised neurophysiology\ninvestigations, such as EEG, for classification of\nepilepsy and management of status epilepticus\nAccess to appropriate neuroimaging, such\nas MRI (preferably reported by specialist\nneuroradiologists)\nAccess to specialised neuropsychology and\nneuropsychiatry services\nAccess to inpatient facilities\nAccess to a medium-term residential/monitoring\nfacility (to allow formal medical, psychological,\npsychiatric, and neurophysiological assessment\nfor those where there is diagnostic doubt or more\ncomplex needs)\nSpecialist assessment and management of recent\nonset epilepsy\nSpecialist management of patients with drug-\nresistant epilepsy\nTertiary referral centre All services provided by teaching hospital or\nepilepsy clinic (see above), plus:\nLong-term EEG monitoring (with and without\nvideo and may include polysomnography)\nAccess to epilepsy surgery\nAccess to intracranial EEG monitoring for epilepsy\nsurgery work up\nAccess to specialist neuroradiology, with reporting\nby specialst neuroradiologists, including:\n• positron emission tomography and interictal\nsingle photon emission computerised\ntomography (SPECT)\n• functional imaging such as ictal SPECT and\nfunctional MRI\n60 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 9 • Models of care\nCurrent preferred practice is for epilepsy clinics to be developed in hospitals, however, where feasible,\nconsideration can be given to developing epilepsy clinics in the community, for example within large primary-\ncare group practices. Consideration should also be given to optimising care for specific groups such as:\ny fast-track clinics for rapid diagnosis of new onset seizures and new epilepsy\ny transition clinics for teenagers and young adults with epilepsy\ny pregnant women with epilepsy\ny individuals with learning disability who have epilepsy.\n9.3 ROLE OF THE EPILEPSY SPECIALIST NURSE\nA consensus document developed by a steering group of adult epilepsy specialist nurses (ESN) for the Royal\nCollege of Nursing,446 describes the role of the adult ESN as including:\ny the empowerment of people with epilepsy by providing information, support, and advice both to people\nwith epilepsy and to carers and families\ny the promotion of a greater understanding of the condition\n4\ny the adoption of a holistic, collaborative and co-ordinated approach that can help reduce the impact of\nepilepsy on the individual and their family.\nThe role of the ESN varies between secondary- and tertiary-service providers. Some ESNs are independent\nprescribers and adjustment of medication is a large part of their duties, some are part of multidisciplinary\nteams involved in the assessment of people with epilepsy being considered for epilepsy surgery, and some\nare involved in recruitment, supervision, training and appraisal of junior ESNs. When recruiting ESNs, NHS\nboards are advised to be aware of the wide scope and variation in ESN expertise, which depends upon the\nESNs prior experience and educational attainment.446\nOne study showed that 70% of patients with epilepsy attending clinics run by ESNs had previously unidentified\nproblems successfully resolved by the nurse including misdiagnosis, overmedication and lack of awareness\n2+\nof drug adverse effects.447\nA systematic review found no evidence that ESN involvement reduced seizure frequency, seizure severity or\nquality of life, however, there was some evidence that ESN involvement might lead to improved knowledge\n2++\nof epilepsy in people with newly diagnosed epilepsy whose knowledge of epilepsy was poor. The poor\nquality of many of the included studies and heterogeneity of outcomes, study populations, interventions\nand timescales across the studies, however, limit interpretation of the results.448\nThe contribution of the ESN to patient care is recognised by the Clinical Standards for Neurological Health\nServices in Scotland which recommend that patients with a new diagnosis of epilepsy should receive an 4\nappointment with an ESN that takes place within 30 working days of the diagnosis.442\nD Each epilepsy team should include epilepsy specialist nurses.\n| 61\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n9.4 SELF MANAGEMENT\nEvidence to support the promotion of self management in people with epilepsy is very limited. A systematic\nreview of self-management strategies for adults with epilepsy identified only two poor-quality trials evaluating\nthe effect of self management (with the intervention, in both, delivered during a two-day programme), both\nreporting high dropout rates of participants (35% and 62%). Seizure frequency decreased significantly in\nthe intervention group in one trial but the other trial reported no significant difference in seizure frequency\nbetween the control and intervention groups. Other benefits reported in one trial included improved\nepilepsy knowledge, improved coping with epilepsy and improved tolerability of AED treatment. The other 2++\ntrial reported a significant increase in overall understanding of epilepsy, a significant decrease in fear of\nseizures, and a significant decrease in hazardous medical self-management practices. The extent to which\nthese interventions are generalisable to other patients in other situations is not known nor is the benefit in\nthe long term (assessment in the two trials included in the review was at four months and six months after\nthe intervention).448\nProvision of information to people with epilepsy and their carers is covered in section 10.\n Patients with epilepsy should be provided with appropriately tailored information to expand their\nknowledge and understanding of their condition and its management.\n62 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 10 • Provision of information\n10 Provision of information\nThis section reflects the issues likely to be of most concern to patients and their carers. These points are\nprovided for use by health professionals when discussing epilepsy with patients and carers and in guiding\nthe production of locally-produced information materials.\n2++ 10.1 ADVICE AND INFORMATION ON EPILEPSY\nPeople with epilepsy and their carers have a need for clear, accurate and appropriate information and advice.\nSurveys have reported that up to 90% of patients want more information and felt that they had received\nlittle advice about the cause of epilepsy, effects and interactions of drugs and the avoidance of potentially\ndangerous situations.449, 450 Conversely, it is known that patients can forget or fail to take in much of what\nthey are told during clinic visits so written information, and helpline telephone numbers and contact details\nof voluntary organisations should be given to all patients. People should be empowered to manage their\ncondition as well as possible and information should be tailored to the person’s needs.\nAlmost as important as the quality of information is the manner in which it is given. Many patients prefer\ntalking to an epilepsy nurse or someone from a voluntary organisation with whom they feel more at ease.451\nSome information may have to be repeated on different occasions to ensure understanding. Patients with\n3\nepilepsy place great importance on having a doctor who is approachable, communicative and knowledgeable 4\nand on receiving adequate information on their condition.452\nA general information leaflet should be offered to all patients at the time of diagnosis. Epilepsy checklists\nare available from support organisations. Information for patients should be suited to their understanding,\nmaking adjustments for different developmental ages, gender, culture and stage of life of the person.453 It\nshould be noted that children are frequently carers of a parent with epilepsy, and need to be given proper\nsupport via voluntary organisations and carer’s centres.\nGuidelines for teachers have been produced by Epilepsy Scotland and there is a demand for their training in\nschools, colleges and universities. Information relating to outcomes from such training is currently lacking. A\nsurvey found that there had been little improvement in information provision despite the problem having\nbeen highlighted previously.438 It was concluded that reducing the information deficit would significantly\nreduce the morbidity associated with epilepsy.\nIn Scotland, 4% of the population is from an ethnic minority background. Language, cultural issues, stigma\nand belief systems of people from black and minority ethnic groups may have an impact on an individual’s\naccess to information about their condition, their treatment and care, adherence to medication, and ability\nto cope with and manage their condition. Research is needed to identify any real or perceived barriers\nrelating to diagnosis, receipt of information about epilepsy, and treatment for epilepsy, to allow healthcare\nprofessionals to take these into consideration when working with patients from BME groups.\n Information should be given in an appropriate manner with sufficient time to answer questions.\n Information should be repeated over time and reinforced to ensure understanding.\n Patients should be given information to take home in the most suitable format, for example leaflets,\nfactsheets, a DVD, or specialised material for people with learning disability, making adjustments for\npatients from black and minority ethnic groups.

Mechanisms should be in place to review care provided against the guideline\nrecommendations. The reasons for any differences should be assessed and addressed where appropriate.\nLocal arrangements should then be made to implement the national guideline in individual hospitals, units\nand practices.\nImplementation of this guideline will be encouraged and supported by SIGN.\n11.2 RESOURCE IMPLICATIONS OF KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nNo recommendations are considered likely to reach the £5 million threshold which warrants full cost impact\nanalysis.\n11.3 AUDITING CURRENT PRACTICE\nA first step in implementing a clinical practice guideline is to gain an understanding of current clinical\npractice. Audit tools designed around guideline recommendations can assist in this process. Audit tools\nshould be comprehensive but not time consuming to use. Successful implementation and audit of guideline\nrecommendations requires good communication between staff and multidisciplinary team working.\n11.4 ADDITIONAL ADVICE TO NHSSCOTLAND FROM HEALTHCARE IMPROVEMENT SCOTLAND\nAND THE SCOTTISH MEDICINES CONSORTIUM\ny In December 2012, SMC advised that perampanel (Fycompa®) is accepted for restricted use within\nNHSScotland (Ref SMC No. 819/12). The summary statement from SMC is included below.\n“Following a full submission perampanel (Fycompa®) is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland.\nIndication under review: adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily\ngeneralised seizures in patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older.\nSMC restriction: use as a second-line adjunctive treatment in patients with refractory partial-onset\nepilepsy. Treatment should be initiated only by physicians who have appropriate experience in the\ntreatment of epilepsy.\nIn three placebo-controlled studies in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures, perampanel\nwas superior to placebo in terms of the proportion of patients experiencing a ≥50% reduction in\npartial seizure frequency per 28 days.\nThis SMC advice takes account of the benefits of a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) that improves the\ncost effectiveness of perampanel. This SMC advice is contingent upon the continuing availability of\nthe patient access scheme or a list price that is equivalent or lower.”\n| 69\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\ny In October 2012 SMC advised that zonisamide (Zonegran®) is not recommended for use within\nNHSScotland (Ref SMC No.817/12). The summary statement from SMC is included below.\n“In the absence of a submission from the holder of the marketing authorisation zonisamide (Zonegran®)\nis not recommended for use within NHSScotland.\nIndication under review: monotherapy for the treatment of partial seizures (with or without secondary\ngeneralization) in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy.\nThe holder of the marketing authorisation has not made a submission to SMC regarading theis product\nin this indication. As a result we cannot recommend its use within NHSScotland.”\ny In July 2011, the SMC advised that retigabine (Trobalt®) is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland\n(Ref SMC No. 712/11). The summary statement from SMC is included below:\n“Following a full submission retigabine (Trobalt®) is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland.\nIndication under review: adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary\ngeneralisation in adults aged 18 years and above with epilepsy.\nSMC restriction: patients with refractory epilepsy. Treatment should be initiated only by physicians\nwho have appropriate experience in the treatment of epilepsy.\nIn two placebo-controlled studies in patients with refractory epilepsy retigabine was superior\nto placebo in terms of the proportion of patients experiencing 50% reduction in partial seizure\nfrequency per 28 days. An indirect comparison indicates that retigabine has similar efficacy to two\nother antiepileptic drugs used as adjunctive therapy.”\ny In November 2010 SMC advised that eslicarbazepine acetate (Zebinix) is accepted for restricted use within\nNHSScotland (Ref SMC No. 592/09). The summary statement from SMC is included below.\n“Following a resubmission eslicarbazepine acetate (Zebinix) is accepted for restricted use within NHS\nScotland.\nIndication under review: as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures with or without\nsecondary generalisation.\nSMC restriction: patients with highly refractory epilepsy who have been heavily pretreated and remain\nuncontrolled with existing antiepileptic drugs.\nEslicarbazepine acetate reduces seizure frequency compared to placebo over a 12-week maintenance\nperiod. Direct comparative data versus other antiepileptic drugs are unavailable, particularly\ncomparisons with other cheaper agents with a very similar mode of action.\nThis SMC advice takes account of the benefits of a Patient Access Scheme (PAS) that improves the\ncost effectiveness of eslicarbazepine acetate. This SMC advice is contingent upon the continuing\navailability of the PAS in Scotland.”\ny In January 2009, the SMC advised that lacosamide (Vimpat®) is accepted for restricted use within\nNHSScotland (Ref SMC No. 532/09). The summary statement from SMC is included below.\n“Following a full submission lacosamide (Vimpat®) is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland as\nadjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation\nin patients with epilepsy aged 16 years and older.\nThe proportion of responders was significantly greater with adjunctive lacosamide treatment\ncompared to placebo. Lacosamide use is restricted to patients with refractory epilepsy and treatment\nshould be initiated by physicians who have appropriate experience in the treatment of epilepsy.”\n70 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 11 • Implementing the guideline\ny In February 2008, SMC advised that levetiracetam (Keppra®) is accepted for restricted use within\nNHSScotland (Ref SMC No. 397/07). The summary statement from SMC is included below.\n“Following a resubmission levetiracetam (Keppra®) is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland\nas monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation\nin patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy.\nLevetiracetam has been shown to be non-inferior to an older first-choice antiepileptic drug for partial\nseizures.\nLevetiracetam is significantly more expensive than traditional drugs so its use is restricted to patients for\nwhom the range of traditional drugs normally used for first-line treatment are ineffective or unsuitable.”\ny In February 2008, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) advised that levetiracetam (Keppra®) is\naccepted for restricted use within NHSScotland (Ref SMC No. 396/07). The summary statement from\nSMC is included below.\n“Following a resubmission levetiracetam (Keppra®) is accepted for use within NHSScotland as\nadjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and\nadolescents from 12 years of age with generalised idiopathic epilepsy.\nIn the pivotal study, addition of levetiracetam to existing anticonvulsant therapy achieved a\nsignificantly greater reduction in the frequency of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures than\naddition of placebo.”\ny In December 2005, SMC advised that zonisamide (Zonegran®) is accepted for restricted use within\nNHSScotland (Ref SMC No. 216/05)\n“Following a full submission zonisamide (Zonegran®) is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland\nas adjunctive therapy in adult patients with partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation.\nIt should be initiated only by physicians who have appropriate experience in the treatment of\nepilepsy and should be used principally in patients who have not benefited from treatment with an\nolder anticonvulsant drug such as carbamazepine or sodium valproate, or for whom these drugs are\nunsuitable because of contraindications, interaction or poor tolerance.\ny In January 2005, SMC advised that pregabalin (Lyrica®) is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland\n(Ref SMC No. 145/04). The summary statement from SMC is included below.\n“Following a full submission pregabalin (Lyrica®) is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland as\nadjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation.\nIt should be initiated only by physicians who have appropriate experience in the treatment of\nepilepsy and should be used principally in patients who have not benefited from treatment with an\nolder anticonvulsant drug such as carbamazepine or sodium valproate, or for whom these drugs are\nunsuitable because of contraindications, interaction or poor tolerance.”\ny In January 2004 SMC advised that topiramate is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland (Ref SMC\nNo. 75/03). The summary statement from SMC is included below.\n“Following a full submission topiramate is accepted for restricted use within NHSScotland for its\nextended (monotherapy) indication. It should be initiated only by physicians who have appropriate\nexperience in the treatment of epilepsy.\nTopiramate should be used principally in patients who have not benefited from treatment with an\nolder anticonvulsant drug such as carbamazepine or sodium valproate, or for whom these drugs are\nunsuitable because of contraindications, interactions or poor tolerance. Its use for second-line therapy\nin epilepsy is unaffected by this recommendation.”\n| 71\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n12 The evidence base\n12.1 SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW\nThe evidence base for this guideline was synthesised in accordance with SIGN methodology. A systematic\nreview of the literature was carried out using an explicit search strategy devised by a SIGN Evidence and\nInformation Scientist. Databases searched include Medline, Embase, Cinahl, PsycINFO and the Cochrane\nLibrary. The year range covered was 2001–2013. Internet searches were carried out on various websites\nincluding the US National Guidelines Clearinghouse. The main searches were supplemented by material\nidentified by individual members of the development group. Each of the selected papers was evaluated\nby two members of the group using standard SIGN methodological checklists before conclusions were\nconsidered as evidence.\n12.1.1 LITERATURE SEARCH FOR PATIENT ISSUES\nAt the start of the guideline development process, a SIGN Evidence and Information Scientist conducted a\nliterature search for qualitative and quantitative studies that addressed patient issues of relevance to the\ndiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults. Databases searched include Medline, Embase, Cinahl and\nPsycINFO, and the results were summarised by the SIGN Patient Involvement Officer and presented to the\nguideline development group.\n12.2 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH\nThe guideline development group was not able to identify sufficient evidence to answer all of the key\nquestions asked in this guideline (see Annex 1). The following areas for further research have been identified:\ny What is the best first-line therapy for patients with focal seizures (comparison of new with old AEDs)?\ny What is the best first-line treatment for patients with generalised seizures?\ny What are the most effective combinations of antiepileptic drugs?\ny What non-drug therapies (VNS v DBS) and surgical interventions are most effective for different types\nof seizure?\ny Is there significant benefit in regular therapeutic drug monitoring with newer AEDs compared to older\nAEDs?\ny In which patients is it acceptable to freely switch brands of AED?\ny What second-line drugs for generalised status epilepticus are most effective (comparison of all commonly\nused drugs)?\ny In patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy, does routine EEG significantly improve outcomes?\ny How should bone disease be screened for in those with epilepsy on AEDs?\ny How should fractures be prevented in people with epilepsy on AEDs who have a high risk of osteoporosis?\ny What is the most effective AED to treat seizures in those with Down’s syndrome and dementia?\ny Do pregnancy and perinatal outcomes following induction of labour and Caesarean section in women\nwith epilepsy differ from those where induction of labour or Caesarean section are not performed?\ny Do postpartum haemorrhage rates in women with epilepsy taking AEDs and those not taking AEDs differ\nfrom those in women without epilepsy?\ny Are perinatal outcomes adversely affected in women with epilepsy taking antiepileptic drugs during\npregnancy and how do outcomes differ for different AEDs?\ny Does menopause increase or reduce seizure frequency in women with epilepsy and are effects linked\nto AED treatment?\ny What effect does HRT have on seizure frequency in postmenopausal women with epilepsy and are effects\nrelated to AED treatement?\n72 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults 12 • The evidence base\ny What mechanisms, other than folic acid depletion, explain the teratogenic effect of antiepileptic drugs?\ny Does assistive technology have a place in helping to address memory problems in people with temporal\nlobe epilepsy?\ny How effective are cognitive rehabilitation strategies that target executive function impairment in\nimproving mood, planning and reasoning in those with planning and attention deficits who suffer from\nepilepsy?\ny How effective is education in supporting families to help maintain use of compensatory memory strategies\nby relatives who suffer from epilepsy?\ny What are the optimum models of care for epilepsy in community-, secondary- and tertiary-care?\n12.3 REVIEW AND UPDATING\nThis guideline was published in 2015 and will be considered for review in three years.

These questions form the basis of the systematic literature search.\nSee guideline\nKey question\nsection\n1. What is the sensitivity and specificity of short-term video-EEG, videotelemetry (VT), 3.4, 3.5\npolysomnography and hand-held video capturing (ie phones) in diagnosing epilepsy?\n2. What is the sensitivity and specificity of 24-hour hour cardiography, routine ECG, implanted 3.7\nloop recorders in diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias causing collapses that are mistaken for\nepilepsy?\n3. In adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy are levetiracetam and zonisamide monotherapies 4.2\nmore effective and well tolerated than existing AEDs at reducing seizure frequency, seizure\nduration, and adverse effects, and improving recovery time and QoL?\n4. In adults with epilepsy what is the evidence that switching between drug brands (brand and 4.2\ngeneric) results in worsening seizure control and adverse effects?\n5. Once monotherapy has failed what adjunctive drugs (eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, pregabalin, 4.3\nretigabine, rufinamide, perampanel) are most effective and well tolerated compared to existing\nadd-on therapies or to placebo?\n6. In adults with epilepsy is there evidence that there are any combinations of drugs (rational 4.3, 4.6\npolytherapy) that are more effective and well tolerated than other combinations?\n7. In adults with epilepsy being treated long term with AEDs is there evidence that it adversely 4.6.4\naffects BMD compared with those not taking AEDs?\n8. In adults with drug resistant epilepsy is VNS or DBS more effective than current treatment or 4.9.1, 4.9.2\nplacebo for reducing seizure frequency, seizure duration and adverse effects and improving\nrecovery and QoL?\n9. In adult patients with status epilepticus what is the best drug regime for stopping seizures? 4.10\n10. In adults with a history of prolonged and serial seizures, which drug regime is most effective 4.11\nat reducing seizure duration, severity and improving recovery time?\nConsider: midazolam maleate, midazolam hydrochloride, rectal diazepam, buccal lorazepam,\nwhat form of benzodiazepine?\n11. In people aged 65 or over with epilepsy which AEDs have superior efficacy and tolerability? 4.14\nConsider: carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, sodium valproate,\nethosuximide, clobazam, vigabatrin, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate,\ntiagabine, pregabalin, zonisamide, oxcarbazepine, rufinamide, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide,\nretigabine, perampanel\n12. In people aged 65 or over with epilepsy (with or without dementia) how does QoL differ 4.14.1, 4.14.4\ncompared to older people without epilepsy?\nConsider: multidisciplinary shared care\n13. In people with epilepsy is there any evidence for the management of epilepsy in people with 4.15\nDown’s syndrome and dementia?\n14. In women with epilepsy taking hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs or non-inducing AEDs, what 5.1\nadvice should be given regarding contraception, including postnatal contraception, and\nemergency contraception?\nConsider: combined oral contraceptive pill, progesterone only pill, progesterone implant,\nlevonorgestrel intrauterine system, transdermal patches, condoms, IUCD, levonorgestrel\nemergency contraceptive pill\n80 |\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults Annexes\n15. In women with epilepsy what evidence is there that pre-pregnancy counselling (including 5.2\ngenetic and breastfeeding counselling) improve seizure control and pregnancy outcomes\nand reduce teratogenicity, compared to women who do not receive counselling?\nConsider: women taking and not taking AEDs\n16. For women with epilepsy taking AEDs and prescribed folic acid (folate) for the prevention of 5.2.1\nneural tube defects, what evidence is there to guide healthcare professionals on:\ny daily dose of folic acid (folate) – 5 mg versus 400 micrograms\ny duration of prepregnancy folic acid (folate) dosing (1 month versus 3 months versus\nlonger)\ny duration of folic acid (folate) dosing during pregnancy (first 12 weeks (first trimester)\nversus entire pregnancy?\n17. What factors relating to a woman’s epilepsy (particularly seizure type) will affect the outcome 5.2–5.5\nof her pregnancy?\n18. In pregnant women with epilepsy taking AEDs how should management differ during the 5.4–5.5\nantenatal period, labour, delivery and the postnatal period, compared to pregnant women\nwithout epilepsy?\nConsider: multidisciplinary shared care\n19. In pregnant women with epilepsy who receive AEDs as monotherapy or in combination 5.4–5.6\nwhat evidence is there that there is an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes,\nteratogenicity and epilepsy in offspring, compared to pregnant women with epilepsy not on\nAEDs, and pregnant women without epilepsy?\n20. In pregnant women with epilepsy taking AEDs what evidence is there that those who undergo 5.4.2\nAED regimen manipulation and monitoring of AED circulating plasma concentrations have\nbetter maternal and perinatal outcomes than women with epilepsy taking AEDs who do not?\n21. In pregnant women with epilepsy taking hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs (at presumed risk of 5.4.3\nhaemorrhagic disease of the newborn) how does the maternal administration of oral vitamin\nK from 36 weeks affect the incidence of haemorrhagic disease of the newborn, compared to\nthose taking enzyme inducing AEDs who do not receive oral vitamin K, women with epilepsy\ntaking non-inducing AEDs, and women without epilepsy?\n22. In menopausal women with epilepsy taking AEDs what advice should be given on: 5.9\ny seizure control,\ny hormone replacement therapy?\n23. In people with epilepsy what evidence is there that AEDs cause psychiatric and behavioural 6\nadverse effects and in what patient subgroups is this particularly prevalent (eg learning or\nintellectual disability or geriatric)?\nConsider: anxiety, irritability and aggression\n24. In adults with epilepsy what validated diagnostic or screening tools or ratings scales are 6.1\neffective in determining the presence or absence of significant depression, psychosis or\nanxiety?\nConsider: HADS-D, BDI, NDDI-E, etc.\n25. Does screening for depression and low mood lead to improved adherence, frequency and 6.1, 6.2\nHrQoL?\n26. In adults with epilepsy which talking therapies are shown to be most effective in improving 6.2.1\nmood and seizure frequency?\nConsider: cognitive behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment, mindfulness,\npsychotherapeutic, positive psychology\n27. In adults with epilepsy and depression which psychotropic (antidepressant) drugs are shown 6.2.2\nto be most effective in improving depression and non-exacerbation of seizures?\n| 81\nDiagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults\n28. Does cognitive rehabilitation lead to improvement in medication adherence, HrQoL, mood 6.2.3\nand seizure frequency?\nConsider: neuropsychology, memory, learning, executive function\n29.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze ef-\nficacy, tolerability and safety data for anticonvulsant treatment of children and adults with convulsive status epilepticus and use\nthis analysis to develop an evidence-based treatment algorithm. DATA SOURCES: Structured literature review using MEDLINE,\nEmbase, Current Contents, and Cochrane library supplemented with article reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized\ncontrolled trials of anticonvulsant treatment for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes. DATA EXTRACTION: Individual studies\nwere rated using predefined criteria and these results were used to form recommendations, conclusions, and an evidence-based\ntreatment algorithm. RESULTS: A total of 38 randomized controlled trials were identified, rated and contributed to the assess-\nment. Only four trials were considered to have class I evidence of efficacy. Two studies were rated as class II and the remaining\n32 were judged to have class III evidence. In adults with convulsive status epilepticus, intramuscular midazolam, intravenous\nlorazepam, intravenous diazepam and intravenous phenobarbital are established as efficacious as initial therapy (Level A). Intra-\nmuscular midazolam has superior effectiveness compared to intravenous lorazepam in adults with convulsive status epilepticus\nwithout established intravenous access (Level A). In children, intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam are established\nas efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes (Level A) while rectal diazepam, intramuscular midazolam, intranasal\nmidazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective (Level B). No significant difference in effectiveness has been demon-\nstrated between intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam in adults or children with convulsive status epilepticus (Level\nA). Respiratory and cardiac symptoms are the most commonly encountered treatment-emergent adverse events associated\nwith intravenous anticonvulsant drug administration in adults with convulsive status epilepticus (Level A). The rate of respiratory\ndepression in patients with convulsive status epilepticus treated with benzodiazepines is lower than in patients with convul-\nThe following organizations have endorsed this guideline:\nEpilepsy Foundation\nChild Neurology Society\nAmerican College of Emergency Physicians\nAssociation of Child Neurology Nurses\nAmerican Association of Neuroscience Nurses\nEpilepsy Currents, Vol. 16, No. 1 (January/February) 2016 pp. 48–61\n© American Epilepsy Society\n48\nConvulsive Status Epilepticus Guideline\nsive status epilepticus treated with placebo indicating that respiratory problems are an important consequence of untreated\nconvulsive status epilepticus (Level A). When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred over phenytoin based on tolerability\nbut phenytoin is an acceptable alternative (Level A). In adults, compared to the first therapy, the second therapy is less effective\nwhile the third therapy is substantially less effective (Level A). In children, the second therapy appears less effective and there are\nno data about third therapy efficacy (Level C). The evidence was synthesized into a treatment algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: Despite\nthe paucity of well-designed randomized controlled trials, practical conclusions and an integrated treatment algorithm for the\ntreatment of convulsive status epilepticus across the age spectrum (infants through adults) can be constructed. Multicenter, mul-\ntinational efforts are needed to design, conduct and analyze additional randomized controlled trials that can answer the many\noutstanding clinically relevant questions identified in this guideline.\nBackground therapy and approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of\nTraditionally, brief seizures are defined as lasting less than 5 status epilepticus continue to vary dramatically.

Methods: Systematic review of evidence; modi-\nfied Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process for developing conclusions; recommenda-\ntions developed by consensus. Results: Findings for incidence rates based on 12 Class I studies include the following: SUDEP risk\nin children with epilepsy (aged 0 –17 years) is 0.22/1,000 patient-years (95% CI 0.16–0.31) (high confidence in evidence). SUDEP\nrisk increases in adults to 1.2/1,000 patient-years (95% CI 0.64–2.32) (low confidence in evidence). The major risk factor for SUDEP\nis the occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS); the SUDEP risk increases in association with increasing frequency\nof GTCS occurrence (high confidence in evidence). Recommendations: Level B: Clinicians caring for young children with epilepsy\nshould inform parents/guardians that in 1 year, SUDEP typically affects 1 in 4,500 children; therefore, 4,499 of 4,500 children will\nnot be affected. Clinicians should inform adult patients with epilepsy that SUDEP typically affects 1 in 1,000 adults with epilepsy\nper year; therefore, annually 999 of 1,000 adults will not be affected. For persons with epilepsy who continue to experience GTCS,\nclinicians should continue to actively manage epilepsy therapies to reduce seizures and SUDEP risk while incorporating patient\npreferences and weighing the risks and benefits of any new approach. Clinicians should inform persons with epilepsy that seizure\nfreedom, particularly freedom from GTCS, is strongly associated with decreased SUDEP risk.\nThis practice guideline was endorsed by the International Child\nNeurology Association on August 27, 2016.

Methods: 2004 criteria were used to systematically\nreview literature (January 2003 to November 2015), classify pertinent studies according to the therapeutic rating scheme,\nand link recommendations to evidence strength. Results: Forty-two articles were included. Recommendations: The fol-\nlowing are established as effective to reduce seizure frequency (Level A): immediate-release pregabalin and perampanel\nfor TR adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE); vigabatrin for TRAFE (not first-line treatment; rufinamide for Lennox–Gastuat syndrome\n(LGS) (add-on therapy).\nThe following should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (Level B): lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended-\nrelease topiramate for TRAFE (ezogabine production discontinued); immediate- and extended-release lamotrigine for gen-\neralized epilepsy with TR generalized tonic–clonic (GTC) seizures in adults; levetiracetam (add-on therapy) for TR childhood\nfocal epilepsy (TRCFE) (1 month to 16 years), TR GTC seizures, and TR juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; clobazam for LGS (add-on\ntherapy); zonisamide for TRCFE (6–17 years); oxcarbazepine for TRCFE (1 month to 4 years). The text presents Level C recom-\nmendations. AED selection depends on seizure/syndrome type, patient age, concomitant medications, and AED tolerability,\nsafety, and efficacy. This evidence-based assessment informs AED prescription guidelines for TR epilepsy and indicates\nseizure types and syndromes needing more evidence. A recent FDA strategy allows extrapolation of efficacy across popula-\ntions; therefore, for focal epilepsy, eslicarbazepine and lacosamide (oral only for pediatric use) as add-on or monotherapy in\npersons ≥4 years of age and perampanel as monotherapy received FDA approval.\nEpilepsy Currents, Vol. 18, No. 4 (July/August) 2018 pp. 269–278\n© American Epilepsy Society\n269\nepcu-18-04-14 Page 270 PDF Created: 2018-8-16: 12:22:PM\nAmerican Epilepsy Society Guidelines\nINTRODUCTION\nGlossary\nIn 2004, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the\nAAN: American Academy of Neurology American Epilepsy Society (AES) published a guideline on\nAE: adverse event felbamate (FBM)1 and another guideline on 8 second-generation\nAED: antiepileptic drug antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (table 1 shows principle findings).2\nAES: American Epilepsy Society Since the 2004 publications, the US Food and Drug Administration\nCLB: clobazam (FDA) approved 6 new third-generation AEDs and 2 older AEDs\nESL: eslicarbazepine (table 2).

Methods: The 2004 AAN criteria was used\nto systematically review literature (January 2003 to November 2015), classify pertinent studies according to the therapeutic\nrating scheme, and link recommendations to evidence strength. Results: Several second-generation AEDs are effective for\nnew-onset focal epilepsy. Data are lacking on efficacy in new-onset generalized tonic–clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic\nepilepsy, or juvenile absence epilepsy, and on efficacy of third-generation AEDs in new-onset epilepsy. Recommendations:\nLamotrigine (LTG) should (Level B) and levetiracetam (LEV) and zonisamide (ZNS) may (Level C) be considered in decreas-\ning seizure frequency in adults with new-onset focal epilepsy. LTG should (Level B) and gabapentin (GBP) may (Level C) be\nconsidered in decreasing seizure frequency in patients ≥60 years with new-onset focal epilepsy. Unless there are compelling\nadverse-effect–related concerns, ethosuximide (ETS) or valproic acid (VPA) should be considered before LTG to decrease\nseizure frequency in treating absence seizures in childhood absence epilepsy (Level B).

A recent FDA strategy allows extrapolation of efficacy across populations; therefore, for focal\nepilepsy, eslicarbazepine and lacosamide (oral only for pediatric use) as add-on or monotherapy in persons ≥4 years old and\nperampanel as monotherapy received FDA approval.\nEpilepsy Currents, Vol. 18, No. 4 (July/August) 2018 pp. 260–268\n© American Epilepsy Society\n260\nepcu-18-04-13 Page 261 PDF Created: 2018-8-16: 12:21:PM\nAmerican Epilepsy Society Guidelines\nINTRODUCTION\nGlossary\nIn 2004, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the\nAAN: American Academy of Neurology American Epilepsy Society (AES) published the first evidence-\nAE: adverse events based guidelines on use of 7 second-generation antiepileptic\nAED: antiepileptic drug drugs (AEDs) (table 1 shows principal findings).1,2 A separate\nCBZ: carbamazepine guideline on felbamate (FBM) in intractable epilepsy was pub-\nlished (last reaffirmed July 16, 2016).\nCBZ-CR: controlled-release carbamazepine\nSince the 2004 publications, new studies emerged in the\nCBZ-IR: immediate-release carbamazepine\n8 second-generation and 6 newer (third-generation) AEDs\nCLB: clobazam\n(eslicarbazepine [ESL], ezogabine [EZG], lacosamide [LCM],\nESL: eslicarbazepine perampanel [PER], pregabalin [PGB], rufinamide [RFN]).

Most respondents (80%) were either neurologists or epileptologists.\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium,\nprovided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.\n© 2020 The Authors.

There was a lack of consensus about which health professionals\nwere responsible for screening and management of these comorbidities. About a third\nonly assessed for depression and anxiety following spontaneous report and lack of\ntime was a common barrier (>50%). Routine referrals to psychiatrists (>55%) and\npsychologists (>41%) were common, but approximately one third relied on watchful\nwaiting. A lack of both trained mental health specialists (>55%) and standardized\nprocedures (>38%) was common barriers to referral practices. The majority (>75%)\nof respondents’ patients identified with depression or anxiety had previously accessed\npsychotropic medications or psychological treatments. However, multiple barriers to\npsychological treatments were endorsed, including accessibility difficulties (52%).\nSignificance: The findings suggest that while the importance of managing depression\nand anxiety in patients with epilepsy is being recognized, there are ongoing barriers to\neffective mental health care. Key future directions include the need for updated protocols\nin this area and the integration of mental health professionals within epilepsy settings.\nKEYWORDS\nmental health, psychiatric comorbidity, psychotherapy, screening, suicide, treatment\n1 | INTRODUCTION\nKey Points\nThe prevalence of mental health comorbidities, particularly de-\n• ILAE survey of epilepsy health professional’s pression and anxiety, in people with epilepsy (PWE) is high\nand associated with suboptimal patient outcomes,1,2 such as screening, referral, and management practices for\nreduced quality of life,3 pharmacoresistant seizures,4 suicide,5 depression and anxiety.\ninjuries,6 and medication nonadherence.7 To comprehensively • Less than half felt adequately resourced to man-\nmanage epilepsy and improve quality of life, both behavioral age these comorbidities.\nand seizure specific outcomes need to be addressed.8 Increasing\n• Lack of consensus about which health professionals\nawareness of the importance of and morbidity from mental\nwere responsible for screening and management.\nhealth comorbidities in epilepsy has resulted in International\nLeague Against Epilepsy (ILAE) consensus statements by • Ongoing barriers to mental health care, includ-\nthe ILAE Commission on the Neuropsychiatric Aspects of ing a lack of trained mental health specialists and\nEpilepsy, and the Neuropsychobiology Commission,9,10 and standardized procedures.\nrecommendations of the inclusion of routine screening for • Future directions include need for updated proto-\ndepression and anxiety in PWE according to the American\ncols and the integration of mental health profes-\nAcademy of Neurology’s quality indicators.11,12 It is also now\nsionals within epilepsy settings.\nstrongly encouraged that depression and anxiety should either\nbe treated by epilepsy healthcare professionals or they should\nbe referred for appropriate external management.13\nIt remains unknown to what extent these recommendations However, the recently launched ILAE roadmap for a compe-\nand quality indicators have been adopted in clinical prac- tency-based educational curriculum includes the appropriate\ntice.14–16 For instance, a survey of 102 epileptologists in the management of psychiatric emergencies (eg, suicidal ide-\nUnited States found that less than half routinely screened for ation) and recognition of when to refer patients for treatment\nanxiety and that only 5% utilized a validated screening mea- of mental health comorbidities as key competencies for epi-\nsure.17 Moreover, there is currently little international consen- leptologists.18 This highlights the need to better examine the\nsus about what role neurologists, epileptologists, and other existing clinical landscape and determine what barriers exist\nepilepsy healthcare professionals should play in the man- to the management of mental health comorbidities in PWE.\nagement of mental health comorbidities, and no systematic The ILAE Psychology Task Force of the Medical\napproaches or protocols have been developed in this area.13 Therapies Commission has been charged with improving\n24709239,\n2021,\n1,\nDownloaded\nfrom\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/epi4.12455\nby\nFlorida\nState\nUniversity,\nWiley\nOnline\nLibrary\non\n[06/09/2025].\nSee\nthe\nTerms\nand\nConditions\n(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions)\non\nWiley\nOnline\nLibrary\nfor\nrules\nof\nuse;\nOA\narticles\nare\ngoverned\nby\nthe\napplicable\nCreative\nCommons\nLicense\nGANDY et Al. | 129\nmental health care for PWE.

The framework of the document entailed the\nfollowing phases: conception of the clinical scenarios; literature review; statements re-\ngarding the standard procedures. For literature search a step-wise approach starting\nfrom systematic reviews to primary studies was applied. Published studies were identi-\nfied from the National Library of Medicine’s MEDLINE database and Cochrane Library.\nResults: Scenario 1: despite a low quality of evidence, recommendations on anamnestic\nevaluation, tools for capturing the event at home or in the laboratory are provided for\nspecific SRE. Scenario 2: Early diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders (especially\nrespiratory disorders) in patients with SRE are likely to be beneficial for seizures control.\nConclusions: Definitive procedures for evaluating patients with SRE are lacking. We\nprovide advice that could be of help for standardising and improving the diagnostic\napproach of specific SRE. The importance of identifying and treating specific sleep\ndisorders for the management and outcome of patients with SRE is underlined.\nKEYWORDS\nepilepsy, insomnia, polysomnography, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, sleep-related\nhypermotor epilepsy\n1 | INTRODUCTION the presence of a comorbid sleep disorder is common in these patients,\nwith a potentially negative impact on seizure control, as well as reducing\nEpilepsy and sleep have a reciprocal relationship.

However, the\ndecision to recommend or not a wearable device to an individ-\nual patient is up to the physician treating the patient, and this\ndecision should be tailored to each individual. The wording of\nthe recommendations is according to GRADE: The assessed\nintervention is either recommended or not recommended. For\napplications lacking sufficient evidence at the time of the guide-\nline development, the wording “does not recommend” applies.\nHowever, this should not hamper further research and develop-\nment in the field, but rather stimulate it. To facilitate this, we\nhave highlighted the major areas where further work is needed.\nWhen reviewing the published evidence, we included only\nphase 2- 4 studies, due to the high risk of bias in phase 0-1 stud-\nies. Therefore, we did not include into Table 2 the pilot stud-\nies of the modalities that later led to more robust validation\nstudies.56– 60 Including several hundreds of phase 0-1 studies\non devices and algorithms that were promising, but not prop-\nerly validated yet, was beyond the scope of this working group.\nTwo phase 2 studies were published after the date last searched\n(October 16, 2019), and therefore not included.61,62 However,\nthe message of these studies would not have changed the rec-\nommendations. In a phase 3 study, 14 patients were previously\nenrolled in a phase 1 study.24 However, in the phase 3 study,\nnew data sets (new recordings and seizures) were recorded pro-\nspectively in these patients too. Although the study qualifies as\nphase 3, this was an important limitation of that study, because\nseizures tend to be very stereotyped in a given patient.\nWe found a high- level of evidence that the validated wear-\nable devices accurately detected GTCS and FBTCS. However,\nthere were only two “in-f ield studies” (phase 4)24,25 addressing\nthe applicability, feasibility in the home environment, and clin-\nical benefit of the devices. Although evidence is scarce, data\nfrom one phase 4 study suggest that a device decreased the\nnumber of injuries associated with tonic- clonic seizures.25 In\naddition, based on the existing evidence regarding the associ-\nation between nocturnal supervision and the risk of SUDEP,\nthe practice guidelines of the American Academy of Neurology\nprovide the following recommendation: “Recommendation 4.\nFor persons with frequent GTCS and nocturnal seizures, clini-\ncians may advise selected patients and families, if permitted by\ntheir individualized epilepsy and psychosocial circumstances,\nto use nocturnal supervision or other nocturnal precautions,\nsuch as the use of a remote listening device, to reduce SUDEP\nrisk (Level C).”63 We believe that GTCS- detecting devices trig-\ngering an alarm can be assimilated to remote listening devices,\nand that the above level C recommendation would apply to\nboth types of devices.

Of 590 respondents to the well- being survey\n(422 PWE, 166 caregivers), 22.8% PWE and 27.5% caregivers reported an increase\nin seizure frequency, with difficulty in accessing medication and health care pro-\nfessionals reported as barriers to care. Of all respondents, 57.1% PWE and 21.5%\ncaregivers had severe psychological distress (k score >13), which was signifi-\ncantly higher among PWE than caregivers (p<0.01). An increase in telemedicine\nuse during the COVID- 19 pandemic was reported by health care professionals,\nwith 40% of consultations conducted by this method. Although 74.9% of health\ncare providers thought that this impacted positively, barriers to care were also\nidentified. As we move forward, there is a need to ensure ongoing support and\ncare for PWE to prevent a parallel pandemic of unmet health care needs.\nKEYWORDS\nCOVID- 19, people with epilepsy, psychological distress, telemedicine\n1 | INTRODUCTION\nKey points\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic has\n1.

In preparation for guidelines on the investigation of patients\nwith PNES, the ILAE PNES Task Force carried out an international survey to inves-\ntigate practices of and opinions about SSM. An online questionnaire was developed\nby the ILAE PNES Task Force. Questions were asked at clinical unit or individual\nrespondent level. All ILAE chapters were encouraged to send questionnaires to their\nmembers. The survey was open from July 1, 2019, to August 31, 2019. A total of\n487 clinicians from 411 units across 94 countries responded. Some form of SSM\nwas used in 296/411 units (72.0%). Over 90% reported the use of verbal suggestion,\nover 80% the use of activation procedures also capable of eliciting epileptic activity\n(hyperventilation or photic stimulation). Only 26.3% of units used techniques specifi-\ncally intended to provoke PNES (eg, saline injection). Fewer than 10% of units had\nestablished protocols for SSM, only 20% of units required written patient consent,\nin 12.2% of units patients received explicitly false information to provoke seizures.\nClinicians using SSM tended to perceive no ethical problems, whereas those not using\nSSM were likely to have ethical concerns about these methods. We conclude that the\nuse of invasive nocebo techniques intended to provoke PNES in diagnostic settings\nhas declined, but SSM is commonly combined with activation procedures also capa-\nble of eliciting epileptic activity. While research suggests that openness about the use\nof PNES- specific nocebo techniques does not reduce diagnostic yield, very few units\nhave suggestion protocols or seek patient consent. This could be addressed through\nestablishing consensus guidance for the practice of SSM.\nKEYWORDS\nPsychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), dissociative seizures, provocation methods, activation\nprocedures, electroencephalography, suggestion, diagnosis\n1 | INTRODUCTION\nKey points\nPsychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are a common\n• Use of suggestive seizure manipulation (SSM)\nproblem in neurological practice, with an estimated preva-\nin diagnosing psychogenic nonepileptic seizures\nlence of 50/100 000.1 The process leading to the diagnosis (PNES) has raised ethical concerns\nof PNES is often complex.2 The majority of patients are ini-\n• This survey describes current practice in and at-\ntially diagnosed with epilepsy, and the correct diagnosis of\nPNES can be delayed by several years.3 Twenty to 40 per- titudes toward SSM in the diagnosis of PNES\nacross 411 clinical practices in 94 countries\ncent of patients admitted to tertiary centers turn out to have\nPNES rather than drug- resistant epilepsy.4 The inappropri- • SSM was used in 72% of units.

This manuscript is made available under the Elsevier user license\nhttps://www.elsevier.com/open-access/userlicense/1.0/\nAbstract:\nThere are currently five compounds (clobazam, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate,\nrufinamide) available for prescription with a demonstrated efficacy on drop seizures for\nLennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). There are also currently new and under-investigation\ncompounds. This paper gives an overview on these novel developments for LGS based on the\nlecture given at the French Chapter meeting of the International League Against Epilepsy\n(ILAE) held in Paris in October 2019. Five compounds were discussed. Epidiolex (cannabidiol)\nhas been approved recently based on positive randomized control trials in LGS patients. Four\ndrugs are under investigation according to a search on the ‘clinicaltrials.gov’ database.\nPerampanel and fenfluramine are both being studied in ongoing phase 3 studies. Two\ncompounds are in an earlier stage of development with ongoing phase 1 and 2 studies:\ncarisbamate and OV953. We summarized the publicly available data. Based on these drug\ndevelopment programs, we can expect that new compounds will become available for LGS in\nthe next years, possibly resulting in new treatment paradigms.\nKeywords: cannabidiol; carisbamate; fenfluramine; Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; perampanel\nIntroduction:\nLennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a childhood epileptic encephalopathy (EE). The\ndiagnosis is not always easy since the electroclinical characteristics appear progressively.\nLGS, when fully developed, is defined by the association of many types of seizures including\ntonic seizures, cognitive impairment, and an interictal EEG pattern of diffuse, slow spike-wave\ncomplexes [1]. The main seizure types are tonic seizures, atonic seizures and atypical\nabsences. Tonic seizures remain the main feature, and will persist over time, even into\nadulthood [2]. The classic interictal EEG feature is the slow spike-wave pattern, consisting of\nslow spikes or slow spikes-and-waves organized in prolonged discharges at 1–2 Hz. Bilateral\nfast rhythm patterns (10 Hz or more) or “polyspikes” are typically recorded during slow sleep\nand, when EMG electrodes are used, it is not unusual to observe a concomitant tonic\ncontraction [2].\nChildren with LGS usually experience cognitive regression around the time of diagnosis\nand established LGS is almost always associated with moderate to severe cognitive\nimpairment [2]. Cognitive impairment seems linked to the age of onset and persistence of\nseizures [1]. There are currently six compounds (cannabidiol, clobazam, felbamate,\nlamotrigine, topiramate, rufinamide) that have demonstrated efficacy on drop seizures in LGS\npatients. Even if the primary endpoint used in the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is focused\nonly on reliable and countable events (the drop seizure that is a mixed of tonic and atonic\nseizures), this design has enabled approvals from regulatory agencies making these\ncompounds available for patients. Moreover, there are also effective non-pharmacologic\ntreatments for LGS such as dietary treatment (ketogenic diet and modified Atkins diet), vagal\nnerve stimulation and palliative surgery with callosotomy. Recently, an algorithm of treatment\nhas been proposed by European experts [3].\nDespite this number of approved drugs for LGS, there are still unmet needs for\ntreatment. These drugs provide an improvement, but usually not with sustained long-term\neffect, resulting in a need for a new treatment to stabilize the epileptic activity when a\nworsening occurs. Moreover to date, no disease-modifying treatment has come forward. Even\nif there are many underlying causes, personalized medicine should also be an area of\ninvestigation in this epilepsy syndrome [4].\nThe purpose of this paper, based on the lecture that was given at the 2019 epilepsy\nmeeting of the French chapter of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), is to\ndescribe new treatments for LGS. We focused on one drug (Epidiolex, cannabidiol) recently\napproved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and on compounds being tested in\nrecruiting clinical trials according to the ‘clinicaltrials.gov’ database. There are four ongoing\ndrug development programs: fenfluramine in phase 3 study, perampanel in phase 3 study,\nOV935 in phase 2 study and carisbamate in phase 1 study. Current knowledge about these\ncompounds in LGS is summarized below.\n1. Epidiolex, cannabidiol\nThe precise mechanism by which cannabidiol (CBD) exerts its antiepileptic effects is\nunknown and is under further investigation. However, it is known that CBD does not directly\nactivate CB1 receptors, and is not reported to have psychoactive effects [5]. CDB is\nresponsible for an increase in the active metabolite of clobazam. Two RCTs have been\nconducted in LGS with positive results. In the first RCT, CDB was tested at the daily dose of\n20mg/kg. One hundred seventy-one patients (aged 2-55 years) with treatment-resistant LGS\nwere included resulting in a significant reduction in monthly drop seizure in the CBD group\ncompared to the placebo group [6]. The second RCT evaluated two doses of CBD (10 and 20\nmg/kg/day). Two hundred twenty-five LGS patients were included. A significant reduction in\ndrop seizures was observed for both doses compared to placebo [7]. These data were\npublished more than one year ago. The update for this product is the recent approval by the\nEuropean medicine agency on September 23, 2019. The approval was given in conjunction\nwith clobazam for uncontrolled seizure in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gasatut syndrome [8].\nFor now, prescription in France is available under an early access program (Autorization\ntemporaire d’utilisation, ATU) approved by the French medicine agency.\n2. Fenfluramine\nFenfluramine was used initially as an anti-obesity drug. Case reports suggested that\nfenfluramine could also be used in obsessive compulsive behavior associated with\nphotosensitive seizures. Careful study of the patients who responded best to fenfluramine\nshowed that they were patients with Dravet syndrome. Larger case studies followed by two\nRCTs confirmed that low-dose fenfluramine is indeed effective in Dravet syndrome [9]. Recent\npreclinical evidence suggests that fenfluramine does not act through the serotonin pathway\nalone but also via σ receptors [10].\n1\nA phase 2, open‐label, dose‐finding study of add‐on ZX008 was conducted in 13\npatients aged 3‐18 years with LGS (NCT02655198). The included patients had at least four\nconvulsive seizures in the four weeks prior to starting fenfluramine as adjunctive treatment\ntwice daily at an initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg/d, with incremental dose escalations up to 0.8 mg/kg/d\nor 30 mg/d (maximum dose) every four weeks if no decrease of at least 50% of the convulsive\nseizure frequency, based on seizure diary, occurred. Ten (77%) patients completed the 20\nweeks of fenfluramine treatment with a 53% median reduction in convulsive seizures (n = 13);\nthe median reduction was 60% in the 10 completers. At 15 months in the extension study (n =\n9), median reduction in convulsive seizures was 58%. The most common adverse events were\ndecreased appetite in four patients. No adverse heart effects were recorded [11].\nA phase 3 RCT (NCT03355209) started in November 2017 and aims to include 225\npatients aged 2 to 35 years. Completion of inclusion is expected for December 2019 [12].\n3. Perampanel\nPerampanel is a selective non-competitive antagonist of AMPA receptors. This drug is\ncurrently approved by the EMA for focal-onset seizure and generalized tonic-clonic seizure of\nidiopathic generalized epilepsy in addition to other drugs for patients aged 12 years and above\n[13]. Real-life studies reported few patients (n=11) but limited data on the efficacy are available\nfrom these papers reporting the use of perampanel in different epilepsy syndromes. Our group\nreported the use of perampanel in 13 LGS patients (seven male; mean age, 12.8 years). In\nthis prospective data collection, perampanel was initiated at 2mg/day and titrated to a median\nmaximum dose of 6mg/day. After a mean follow-up of 10.8 months (range, 1-24 months), nine\npatients (69.2%) were responders (≥50% reduction in total seizure frequency) and nine\n(69.2%) were rated by their physician as \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\". Four\npatients (30.8%) discontinued perampanel due to lack of efficacy (n=2) and seizure\naggravation (n=2). No patients discontinued due to other adverse events (AEs). AEs were\nreported for six patients (46.2%) and comprised decreased activity/social interaction (n=3),\nbehavior disturbance with agitation (n=2), and/or fatigue (n=2). All AEs became manageable\nafter perampanel dosing was decreased. Introduction of perampanel allowed dose reduction\nand/or discontinuation of other treatments in seven patients (53.8%) [14].\nA phase 3 RCT (NCT02834793) started in December 2016 and aims to include 142\npatients. Completion of inclusion is expected for August 2020.\n4. Soticlestat - OV953/TAK-953\nSoticlestat has showed an anticonvulsant effect in various preclinical models. It is the\nfirst-in-class inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CH24H) and is currently\ninvestigated as an antiseizure compound. CH24H is predominantly expressed in the brain,\ninvolved in cholesterol homeostasis. CH24H converts cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol\n(24HC). The exact underlying mechanism is under investigation but it is currently believed that\nsoticlestat acts through a modulation of the excitatory pathway. A first phase 1b/2a in adult\npatients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies was positive [15]\nA phase 2, prospective, interventional, open-label, multi-site, extension study to assess\nthe long-term safety and tolerability of Soticlestat TAK-935 (OV935) as adjunctive therapy in\npatients with rare epilepsy (NCT03635073) aims to include 176 patients with various rare\nepilepsy syndromes including LGS (but also Dravet Syndrome, Dup15q Syndrome, CDKL5\nDeficiency Disorder). The trial started July 2018 and is expected to be completed by 2023.\n5. Carisbamate\nCarisbamate possesses potent and broad-spectrum activity in a battery of well-\ncharacterized animal seizure models in which seizures are induced electrically, chemically or\nby kindling, with median effective dose (ED50) values ranging from 5 to 60 mg/kg. Inhibition of\nvoltage-dependent brain-type sodium channels appears to be the major identified mechanism\nof the antiepileptic activity of carisbamate. The drug development has been modified after a\nnegative phase 3 study [16].\nOn the clinicaltrials.gov database, we found an ongoing phase I, open-label,\npharmacokinetic, dose escalation study of carisbamate in adult and pediatric subjects with\nLGS. This study started in February 2019 (NCT03731715) aiming to include 24 participants by\nDecember 2019.\nConclusion\nThere are several ongoing research programs evaluating the efficacy and safety of new\ncompounds as antiseizure drugs for LGS. This is an important opportunity for the future\nbecause there are still several unmet needs in LGS. First, all LGS patients still have\npharmacoresistant epilepsy. Second, current evaluation of antiseizure drugs for LGS focuses\nonly on drop seizure that is a mix of atonic and tonic seizures despite the fact that there are\nother seizure types in this syndrome. Finally, we definitely need a paradigm shift for the\ndevelopment of disease-modifying medicines capable of altering the course of the diseases\nrather than simply modifying epileptic symptoms.\nConflict of interest\nStéphane Auvin has served as consultant or received honoraria for lectures from Advicenne\nPharma, Biocodex, Eisai, GW Pharma, Novartis, Nutricia, Shire, UCB Pharma, Ultragenyx,\nZogenyx.

This instrument was found to have\nexcellent psychometric properties in a large population-\nbased sample.16– 18 It is one of only two instruments\nfor adults without epilepsy that provided information\non test- retest reliability. Moreover, four different sub-\nscales emerged: Negative Stereotypes; Risk and Safety\nConcerns; Work and Role Expectations; and Personal\nFear and Social Avoidance. Items from this scale are\nbeing used by the CDC in ongoing national surveys to\nmonitor changes in attitudes toward epilepsy in the\nUnited States.18\nAnother instrument that had extensive testing of reli-\nability and validity at initial development is the Attitudes\nToward Persons with Epilepsy (Table 1).19 Of the 28 items\nincluded in this instrument, 21 measure attitudes to-\nward persons with epilepsy. The instrument was tested\non a large, diverse sample of adults including graduate\nand undergraduate college students, professionals at\nhealth and human service agencies, teachers and school\nadministrators, and participants at professional confer-\nences and workshops. It was found to have three factors:\nDestructive Personal Stereotypes, Integration in Society, and Behavioral Optimism.\n3.2.2 | Instruments for children\nwithout epilepsy\nAll three instruments developed for administration to\nchildren without epilepsy were multidimensional (Table\n2). The instruments were developed and tested in North\nAmerica. One questionnaire, Teen Survey on Epilepsy,\nwas tested in a large Epilepsy Foundation survey of 19,441\nadolescents attending high school across a large region of\nthe United States.20 However, a major limitation of the in-\nstrument is that the only psychometric property described\nwas content validity. The other two instruments were\ndeveloped in Canada, and both incorporated knowledge\nand attitude subscales.21,22 These instruments had better\ninitial development, and the articles provided information\nthat both reliability and validity were strong. One instru-\nment, Thinking about Epilepsy, was developed for chil-\ndren in the 5th grade21 and administered to a large sample\nof 783 school children. The other instrument, Elementary\nSchool Epilepsy Survey, was developed for children in grades 4, 5, and 622 and tested on a sample of 155 chil-\ndren. Both used content evaluation by experts and factor\nanalysis to support validity, and both found good internal\nconsistency reliability. For the latter scale, test- retest reli-\nability for the entire scale was found to be good.22 None of\nthe scales provided information on responsiveness, floor-\ning or ceiling effects, or interpretability.\n)deunitnoC(\n3\nELBAT\nsmetI\nlatoT\nemaN\nelacS\nyrtnuoC(\nnoigeR\nseitreporP\ncirtemohcysP\namgits(\ntegraT\nraeY\n)egaugnal\n/deretsinimdA\nselcitrA\n)noitartsinimda\ntnemurtsnI(\n)smeti\nsucoF\necneiduA\nsnoitatiC#\nton\n/yekruT(\nacirfA\nhtroN\n23.la\nte\nsabyaB\nerew\nsmetI\n:ytidilav\ntnetnoC\n)23(\n23\namgitS\ntleF\nredlO\n,stludA\ndedivorP\nemaN\noN\n)deificeps\necneirepxe\nlacinilc\nmorf\ndepoleved\nstnecselodA\n7102\n:raeY\n:srotcaf\n5 detacidni\nsisylana\nrotcaF\n)37\n–51(\n71\n:snoitatiC#\n,noitanimircsid\n,noitalosi\nlaicoS\ndna\n,sfeileb\neslaf\n,ycneiciffusni\necnatsiser\namgits\ndetalerroc\nsaw\namgits\nretaerG\n:ytidilaV\nssel\n.ycneuqerf\neruzies\nretaerg\nhtiw\nsnoitacidem\nerom\ndna\n,noitacude\n29.\n= α\n:elacs\nelohw\nrof\nytilibaileR\n)eriannoitseuq\ntroper\n-fleS(\n.elacs\nfo\ntnempoleved\nlanigiro\nfo\nelcitra\neht\nrof\nera\nsnoitatiC\n#\n.tnempoleved\nfo\nraey\nfo\nredro\nni detsil\nera\nstnemurtsnI\n:etoN\n.naem\n,M\n:noitaiverbbA\n.seitreporp\ncirtemohcysp\ngnibircsed\nelcitra\neno\nnaht\nerom\nhtiw\ntnemurtsnIa\n.)detset\nseitreporp\ncirtemohcysp\nerom\n.e.i(\ndepoleved\nllew\nsi\ntnemurtsnIb\n15281167,\n2022,\n3,\nDownloaded\nfrom\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.17133\nby\nFlorida\nState\nUniversity,\nWiley\nOnline\nLibrary\non\n[06/09/2025].\nSee\nthe\nTerms\nand\nConditions\n(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions)\non\nWiley\nOnline\nLibrary\nfor\nrules\nof\nuse;\nOA\narticles\nare governed\nby\nthe applicable\nCreative\nCommons\nLicense\n610 | AUSTIN et al.\n3.3 | Instruments for people Parent Stigma Scale by Austin were modified to make\nwith epilepsy them relevant for self- report of felt stigma by adults with\nepilepsy.34 Respondents rate each of the 10 items on a\nSixteen studies described the development of 14 instru- 7- point scale from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree\nments to measure stigma perceptions in people with epi- with higher scores reflecting greater stigma.

without epilepsy\nSajatovic, 201744 This web-b ased randomized controlled trial out of North America used two brief videos aimed at stigma\nreduction vs. a control video. All videos were developed by community stakeholders. The targets\nwere students and the general public. Stigmatizing attitudes were measured using the Attitudes and\nBeliefs about Living with Epilepsy (ABLE). Almost half of those who participated were or knew\nsomeone with epilepsy.\nTekle- Haimanot, 201683 The comic book set within the context of the African culture was designed to allow school children to\nbetter understand epilepsy and appreciate the stigma and exclusion it can lead to. The aim was also\nto involve them more to fight the myths and misconceptions related to this disease and share their\nnew knowledge within their family. A KAP that included a single stigma attitude was given pre- and\npost- reading of the comic book.\nMecarelli, 201582 The intervention was an educational kit that included a pamphlet and video accompanied by a teaching\nsession. A KAP survey was delivered before the intervention and 3 months post intervention.\nAlaquel, 201543 The intervention was an epilepsy awareness campaign with KAP surveys delivered the same day as the\nintervention at randomly chosen selection of malls, universities, and schools.\nElafros, 201341 Monthly 2- hour peer support groups with content determined by meeting participants. Trained\nfacilitators encouraged participants to share life experiences and, ultimately, to exchange problem-\nsolving advice and discuss coping techniques related to epilepsy and epilepsy associated\nsocial and medical challenges. In addition, a clinician was present to answer any medical questions\nBrabcova, 201381 This study compared an animated video vs. an educational drama vs. no intervention for stigma\nreduction among primary school children. The video was a 20-m inute video developed by the\nNational Epilepsy Society. The drama engaged children and was led by experts in educational drama.\nA KAP measured attitudes prior to the intervention and 6 months later.\nBozkaya, 201079 Single lecture by pediatric neurologist followed by discussion session and videos of seizures given to\nstudents in grades 6, 7, 8. Content: types and manifestations of epilepsy, diagnosis, first aid and\ncauses. Divided into 3 groups: high SES, low SES, rural areas. KAP−25 question instrument was\nadministered before and four weeks following.\nMartiniuk, 201080 Public service announcement (60 seconds) with KA survey administered pre- and one-m onth post PSA\nto all grade 5 students.\nRoberts, 201049 This 10 minute first-a id educational video \"Epilepsy: Help by Understanding\" was given to university\npsychology students. Knowledge and attitudes were compared pre- and post-i ntervention.\nKumari, 200938 Receiving regular treatment, including comprehensive psychosocial intervention, for at least 1 year\nAydin, 200752 A single, 45- minute seminar was given to primary school teachers. Content was nature of epilepsy,\ncauses, consequences, social/professional/legal aspects, attitude training, and first aid. KAP−18\nquestion instrument was administered pre- and 30 days post-s eminar.\nFernandes, 200747 20- hour course: \"Epilepsy and Health\" training course – 8 hours on epilepsy, 12 hours on educational\nmethods to use in class on theme of epilepsy given to primary school teachers KAP−47 question\ninstrument was administered before and after course.\nFernandes, 200751 Courses for physicians, community leaders, and Health Care Workers (HCWs). Content: Module I: 8-\nhour course for MDs for pragmatic management per Brazil demonstration project. Module II: 3-h our\ncourse for community leaders and HCW's for social reintegration. Module III: training the trainer,\n20- hour course for physicians to train others. KAP administered pre- and 6 months post-m odules for\nhealth care deliverers.\nMartiniuk, 200721 Education intervention was a single 30 minute scripted \"Thinking about Epilepsy\" program that\nincluded posters, photographs, TV commercials, puppet shows, role playing given to grade\n5 students. KAP−33 question instrument was administered at baseline and one month after\nintervention.\nTedrus, 200777 A 2- hour workshop using audio visual materials produced by the Brazilian League against Epilepsy.\nTesting was a pre- vs. post- comparison of an attitude scale that was administered to a self-s elected\nsubgroup of the intervention participants (University students in health-r elated majors 1 week after\nthe intervention).\n(Continues)\n15281167,\n2022,\n3,\nDownloaded\nfrom\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.17133\nby\nFlorida\nState\nUniversity,\nWiley\nOnline\nLibrary\non\n[06/09/2025].\nSee\nthe\nTerms\nand\nConditions\n(https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions)\non\nWiley\nOnline\nLibrary\nfor\nrules\nof\nuse;\nOA\narticles\nare\ngoverned\nby\nthe\napplicable\nCreative\nCommons\nLicense\nAUSTIN et al. | 619\nTABLE 7 (Continued)\nAuthor, year Description of intervention\nNoronha, 200778 8- hour course on epilepsy given to 5/6- year medical students.

Materials and demonstration given by \"researcher.\" 3 groups: 1) appropriate intervention to\nseizure 2) inappropriate 3) control. Stigma Scale of Epilepsy was administered before and 6 months\nafter the intervention.\nBekiroglu, 200476 Four lecture seminars were given to primary school teachers over a 2-y ear period. Content: nature of\nepilepsy, causes, consequences, social/professional/legal aspects, attitude training, and first aid.\nKAP−29 question instrument was administered before the seminars and after (2+ years).\nKim, 200375 The intervention was a public education campaign. Mass media and lectures one a year for 2 years in\nconjunction with a mandatory agriculture lecture given to general public. Small group discussions 3\nper year. KAP administered before and after (4 years later) the education.\nYoung, 200267 15- minute exposure to informational brochure \"All About Epilepsy\".

The survey\nwas completed by one representative per country. Response rate was 73.2% (101\ncountries of the 138 represented in ILAE and/or IBE organizations). Availability\nand access of ASMs, including distribution problems and costs, reimbursement\nprocedures, general barriers to access to care, and presence of projects targeted\ntoward improving care access, were studied, and descriptive statistics on avail-\nable responses were performed. Among the 15 first- generation ASMs surveyed,\ncarbamazepine was reported as the most widely available globally. At least one\nfirst- generation ASM is widely available in most countries, but their number dif-\nfers dramatically across income levels. Second- and third- generation ASMs are\neven more limited in MICs and LICs. Additionally, average retail prices for ASMs\nwere not significantly different across countries despite the differences in per\ncapita income from high- income countries to LICs. This survey provides a wor-\nrisome picture of availability and accessibility of ASMs across the world, with\nwide disparities according to socioeconomic status. Recommendations for direct\naction on improving access to care will be discussed.\nKEYWORDS\naccess to medication, antiseizure medications, epilepsy, low-r esource regions, treatment gap\n1 | INTRODUCTION\nKey Points\nHealth systems worldwide—f rom large, urbanized set-\n• Availability of ASMs greatly differed across\ntings to remote, isolated areas— are constantly challenged\ncountries per World Bank income classification\nin the provision of basic medical services and pharmaceu-\n• Second- and third- generation ASMs were pri-\ntical access to patients.
